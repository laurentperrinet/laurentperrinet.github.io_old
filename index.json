As such, the visual system needs to detect local edges and to bind them together to form contours at a higher, more global level. A state-of-the art theory is that of the “association field”: the confidence of an edge depends on the configuration of neighboring edges. For instance it is facilitated for co-linear or co-circular edges. This process takes advantage of the statistical regularities of edges that are present in natural images. In particular, we have developed a method to quantify the association field in different classes of natural images (Perrinet \u0026amp; Bednar, 2015). Using an existing library, it is possible to compute histograms of edge co-occurrences from the sparse representation of static natural images. We have already shown that these different statistics were sufficient to categorize images, for instance to know if they contain an animal or not. At the neural level, modeling the representation of the image, such as that formed in the primary visual cortex of primates (V1), this heuristics translates to a set of rules that adapts dynamically the activity of isolated neurons representing edges into the coherent population activity of contours. \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;Yet, we miss an understanding of the link between these statistics and the probabilistic rules that binds features together and how this information is dynamically encoded in V1.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\nObjectives In this computational neuroscience project, we will exploit our current expertise in computer vision for the statistical integration of visual of objects to translate them in the form of probabilistic predictive models for biological vision. \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;Our core hypothesis is that in natural scenes, contours follow coherent trajectories and that this knowledge is integrated (learned) by the visual system to optimally inform the representation of the image.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\nMethods First, we will learn the different classes of edge co-occurrences that are relevant to natural images. Using an existing unsupervised learning algorithm, we will learn these as an independent components analysis. Such an algorithm extends well to a deep-learning convolutional neural network, but importantly, it will be informed by our expertise of modeling neural networks in low-level visual areas by including horizontal connectivity. We expect that relevant features will be mainly the predictable arrangements, such as co-linear or co-circular pairs of edges, but also highly surprising ones, such as T-junctions or end-stopping features. Importantly, we will be able to compare this representation with that present in higher level areas and to refine our knowledge on the representation of natural-like images. Second, we have previously found that using synthetic textures could further advance our understanding of neural computations and perception. These random synthetic textures, coined “Motion Clouds” were initially targeted to quantify the integration properties of visual motion perception (Leon et al, 2012, Simoncini et al, 2012). Informed by the generative model of edge co-occurrences studied above, an extension to such stimuli would be to include dependencies between different elements. As such, we will be able to manipulate the level of dependency between different elements, whether in space, time or feature space (orientations). A potential outcome will be to use these in neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments within the team. In particular, the ability to select different classes of dependencies learned above will make it possible to evaluate the relative contribution of each component to the association field.\nExpected results Finally, those two tasks converge to a long-term goal of \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;understanding the impact of the spatio-temporal structure of natural images in the neural computations implementing visual processing in low-level visual areas and perception\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;. Indeed, the regularities observed in static images can be extended to dynamical scenes by observing that a co-occurrence in time can be implemented by simple geometrical operations as they are operated during that period. For instance a co-circularity can be described as a smooth roto-translational transformation of an edge along a smooth trajectory. Importantly, such a distinction should allow us to determine the hierarchy of different features relevant to describe the full statistics of the feature space (that is, of spatio-temporal edge co-occurrences). We expect to see that the different independent features should decompose at various scales both in space and in time. This translates into a probabilistic hierarchical model that would combine dependencies from different cues. In particular, we expect to see the emergence of differential pathways for form and motion.\nFeasibility The project is based on existing expertise and libraries in computer vision and computational neuroscience. The extension of this expertise to the dynamical domain will be made possible thanks to an existing collaboration (JM Morel at ENS-Cachan, G Peyré at ENS-Ulm). The groundbreaking nature of the work takes advantage of the interaction with neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments thanks to the use of synthetic textures (collaboration with F Chavane, INT; Y Fregnac, UNIC) as planned in a the parallel (approved) grant Horizontal-V1.\nReferences  Simoncini C, Perrinet LU, Montagnini A, Mamassian P, Masson GS (2012) More is not always better: dissociation between perception and action explained by adaptive gain control.

Together with the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), it forms the early visual system, which has become a common model for studying computational principles in the sensory systems. Simple artificial stimuli (such as drifting gratings (DG)) have given precious insights into the neural basis of visual processing. However, recently more researchers have used more complex natural images (NI) visual stimuli, arguing that the low dimensional artificial stimuli are not sufficient for a complete understanding of the visual system. For example, whereas the responses of V1 neurons to DG are dense but with variable spike timings, the neurons are activated with only few and precise spikes to NI. Furthermore, if linear receptive field models provide a good fit to responses during simple stimuli, they often fail during NI.\nTo investigate the mechanisms behind the stimulus dependent responses of cortical neurons we have built a biophysical, yet simple and comprehensible, model of the early visual system. We show how the spatial and temporal stimulus properties interact with the model architecture to give rise to differential response behaviour. Our results show in particular that during NI, the LGN afferents show epochs of correlated activity. These temporal correlations are necessary to induce transient excitatory synaptic inputs, and result in precise spike timings in V1. Furthermore, the sparseness of the responses to NI can be explained by a hardwired, correlated and lagging inhibitory conductance, or conductance temporal window, which is induced by the interactions of the thalamocortical circuit with the spatiotemporal correlations in the stimulus.\nWe continue by investigating the origin of nonlinear responses during NI in the temporal window, by comparing models of different complexity. Our results suggest first that adaptive processes shape the responses, depending on the temporal properties of the stimuli. The different spatial properties can result in nonlinear inputs through the recurrent cortical network. We then study the functional consequences of correlated excitatory and inhibitory condutances in more details in general models. These results show that: (1) spiking of individual neurons becomes sparse and precise, (2) the selectivity of signal propagation increases and the detailed delay allows to gate the propagation through feed-forward structures (3) and recurrent cortical networks are more stable and more likely to elicit in vivo type activity states. Lastly our work illustrates new advances in methods of constructing and exchanging models of neuronal systems by the means of a simulator independent description language (called PyNN). We use this new tool to investigate the feasibility of comparing software simulations with neuromorphic hardware emulations. The presented work give new perspectives on the way conductances can be used for computations and it opens the door for more elaborated models of visual system\u0026rsquo;s mechanisms.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1557926661,"objectID":"2694be611ae15e17c0ebceda5740e2cd","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/authors/jens-kremkow/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/jens-kremkow/","section":"authors","summary":"Correlating Excitation and Inhibition in Visual Cortical Circuits: Functional Consequences and Biological Feasibility (PhD, 2006-01 / 2009-05) The goal of the FACETS (Fast Analog Computing with Emergent Transient States) project was to create a theoretical and experimental foundation for the realisation of novel computing paradigms which exploit the concepts experimentally observed in biological nervous systems.

Low-level sensory areas are therefore an excellent model for exploring how neural computations solve the problem of selecting a single, coherent and global representation from the dispersed information collected locally and in parallel by neurons. Our goal in this program is to study the dynamics of neural fields implementing probabilistic computations for early sensory processing. Emphasis will be put onto the role of anisotropic diffusion, in particular within a cortical area through lateral interactions.\nWe have previously elaborated probabilistic (Perrinet \u0026amp; Masson, 2010) or dynamical (Tlapale et al., 2010) models of motion information diffusion along cortical retinotopic trajectories. Probabilistic models give a complete representation of the information that is represented by populations of neurons. In such a dynamical system, prediction acts as a prior, filtering possible future states knowing the current one. An approximation using particle filtering methods will be used to investigate how this propagation can solve low-level computational problems such as integration, extrapolation or prediction in visual (Mason \u0026amp; Ilg, 2010) or somatosensory (Shulz et al. 2006) cortices.\nUsing this architecture, we will explore the consequences of such context-dependent propagation in terms of coding and of learning. First at the time scale of coding, knowing the prior, we will study the emergent properties of the system like its ability to track objects independently of their shape or to segment parts of the scene that are moving coherently. We will study of this motion information may help shape the selectivity of neurons in a given area, for instance orientation selectivity on the priamry visual cortex. At the time scale of learning, we will build models exploring the emergence of maps of cortical receptive fields optimally tuned to elaborate sparse, multi-scale representations of the visual or tactile world. In fact, a simple functional model allows to understand emergence in a model of a simple macro-column of the primary visual cortex (Perrinet, 2010). One challenging question is whether these functional models of self-organization can be translated to large-scale networks of the early sensory system. Using the probabilistic model, we will investigate how spatio-temporal receptive fields can emerge through learning of statistical regularities in the images and study how hierarchic structures can arise as a self-organized property.\nPropriétés émergentes d\u0026rsquo;un modèle de prédiction probabiliste utilisant un champ neural Dans le système visuel de bas niveau, des informations sur le monde visuel tel que celles représentées par l\u0026rsquo;activité neuronale est dynamiquement causée par l\u0026rsquo;entrée sensorielle, mais aussi par des informations contextuelles provenant de cellules voisines et par le signal réentrant d\u0026rsquo;autres aires corticales. Les aires sensorielles primaires sont donc un excellent modèle pour étudier comment les neurones peuvent résoudre le problème de la sélection d\u0026rsquo;une seul représentation globale et cohérente depuis l\u0026rsquo;information collectée localement et en parallèle par les neurones. Notre objectif dans ce programme est d\u0026rsquo;étudier la dynamique de champs neuronaux mettant en œuvre des calculs probabilistes pour le traitement sensoriel précoce.\nL\u0026rsquo;accent sera mis sur le rôle de la diffusion anisotrope, en particulier celle implémentée par les interactions latérales dans une aire corticale. Nous avons déjà élaboré des modèles probabiliste (Perrinet \u0026amp; Masson, 2010) ou dynamique (Tlapale et al., 2010) de diffusion de l\u0026rsquo;information de mouvement le long de trajectoires. Les modèles probabilistes donnent une représentation complète de l\u0026rsquo;information qui est représentée par des populations de neurones. Dans un tel système dynamique, la prédiction agit comme un prior, qui permet un filtrage des états futurs possibles en sachant la distribution de probabilité de l\u0026rsquo;état actuel. Une approximation à l\u0026rsquo;aide des méthodes de filtrage particulaires seront utilisées pour étudier comment cette propagation peut résoudre des problèmes de calcul de bas niveau telles que l\u0026rsquo;intégration, l\u0026rsquo;extrapolation ou la prédiction dans les système visuel (Mason \u0026amp; Ilg, 2010) ou somatosensoriel (Shulz et al. 2006).\nEn utilisant cette architecture, nous allons explorer les conséquences de la propagation dépendant du contexte tant en termes de codage que d\u0026rsquo;apprentissage. Premièrement, à l\u0026rsquo;échelle de temps de codage, connaissant l\u0026rsquo;architecture du réseau, nous allons étudier les propriétés émergentes du système, comme sa capacité à suivre les objets indépendamment de leur forme ou à segmenter des parties de la scène qui se déplacent de façon cohérente. Nous allons étudier le mouvement de cette information peut aider à façonner la sélectivité des neurones, par exemple la sélectivité à l\u0026rsquo;orientation sur le cortex visuel primaire. À l\u0026rsquo;échelle de temps d\u0026rsquo;apprentissage, nous allons construire des modèles d\u0026rsquo;émergence de cartes de champs récepteurs corticaux optimisées pour élaborer des représentations multi-échelles efficaces de l\u0026rsquo;univers visuel ou tactile.

Our models range from purely random to distance-dependent connectivities including patchy projections, i.e., spatially clustered synapses. Analyzing the characteristic measures for synchronicity and regularity in neuronal spiking, we explore and compare the phase spaces and activity patterns of our simulation results. Depending on the input parameters, different dynamical states appear, similar to the known synchronous regular (SR) or asynchronous irregular (AI) firing in random networks. Our structured networks, however, exhibit shifted and sharper transitions, as well as more complex activity patterns. Distance-dependent connectivity structures induce a spatio-temporal spread of activity, e.g., propagating waves, that random networks cannot account for. Spatially and temporally restricted activity injections reveal that a high amount of local coupling induces rather unstable AI dynamics. We find that the amount of local versus long-range connections is an important parameter, whereas the structurally advantageous wiring cost optimization of patchy networks has little bearing on the phase space.\nContext The goal of the FACETS (Fast Analog Computing with Emergent Transient States) project was to create a theoretical and experimental foundation for the realisation of novel computing paradigms which exploit the concepts experimentally observed in biological nervous systems.

In particular, aerial robots, also known as drones, provide a breakthrough to easily image and access all sorts of terrains and situations and are useful for instance in surveillance and forensics, emergency industrial inspection or a search and rescue operation. A major difficulty for their global acceptance is the difficulty for controlling their flight and interacting with them.\nIndeed, aerial robots are generally operated using a (central) ground station which is not compatible with the time pressure required by emergency conditions, for instance when rescuing a person out of reach with the ground station. This PhD project aims at concealing such obstacles and construct an aerial robot which is able to be autonomously and interactively controlled by simple human gestures, for instance that of a rescuer. The main scientific challenges are (i) to embed in the aerial robot all the electronics for the visual system from the retina to the control signals to the propellers, (ii) to very quickly recognize a variety of simple gestures on-board using a neuromimetic architecture and (iii) to make the robot react in real time to these gestures. As such, this project is inter-disciplinary by positively combining advanced algorithms from event-based bio-inspired computer vision and the latest technology in aerial robots.\n R. Benosman , S.-H.

It first concerns biology and neuroscience because its event-based approach is strongly inspired from the neuronal network observed in animals such as insects to primates and used for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and sensori-motor control. It is also covering electronics, aerial robotics and signal processing as the main project achievement is to create a working spike-based electronic architecture able to recognize body movement, and to use it to control the robot. Such an oucome will have beneficial outcomes with respects to the SRI-S3 regional strategy, in particular with respect to “risks, security and safety”.\nThis project is a partnership between two different doctoral schools based in Marseille: the EDSMH at ISM for the robotic part, and the EDSVS at INT concerning visual processing and spike-based processing methods. This partnership will provide the ESR with the best resources to achieve his goals. In particular, the ISM owns a brand new flying arena (funded by Robotex project, www.marseilles-flying-arena.eu) equipped with high-tech motion capture tools (Vicon) and the INT has a entire technological platform dedicated for high-performance computing and measurement tool prototyping.\nCombining neuroscience and robotics to design novel electronic architectures is an innovative and a valuable approach in Robotics. The doctoral student selected for this project will acquire experience in bio-inspired hardware architectures, which is going to be valuable in his career as there is a need to adapt actual electronic architecture to for instance spike-based visual processing.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1557927201,"objectID":"91114010830ff1a964236b7870fe74f4","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/authors/victor-boutin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/victor-boutin/","section":"authors","summary":"Controlling an aerial robot by human semaphore gestures using a bio-inspired neural network (PhD, 12\u0026frasl;2016-02/2020)  Venue: Aix-Marseille University DOC2AMU is an innovative H2020-MSCA-COFUND Keywords: Aerial Robots, Vision, Neural Networks, Bio-Inspired Computer Vision, Gaze orientation, learning Thesis director: Dr. Laurent PERRINET, Director\u0026rsquo;s research unit: Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone (INT) Thesis co-supervisition: Dr. Franck RUFFIER Co-director\u0026rsquo;s research unit: Institut des Sciences du Mouvement (ISM)  Description of the PHD thesis project Robotics is a rapidly evolving technology that allows for fast, low-risk and low-cost tasks with a worldwide market of over 80 billion dollars over the next few years.","tags":null,"title":"Victor Boutin","type":"authors"},{"authors":["wahiba-taouali"],"categories":null,"content":" Motion Integration By V1 Population (Post-Doc, 2013-03 / 2015-01) Description Wahiba hold the postdoctoral position at the \u0026ldquo;Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone\u0026rdquo;, CNRS, Marseille (France) to study object motion integration and representation at the level of V1 populations: * The objective is in modeling, with Laurent Perrinet, anisotropic diffusive processes, such as observed in V1, at the functional and neural levels. * The work is done in collaboration with a post-doc in physiology, with Frederic Chavane, that focused on the role of propagation and diffusion of activity at the level of neuronal population in V1 of awake monkeys (using Voltage-sensitive dye imaging and UTAH array recording).\nContext  This grant was funded by a large European integrated project called BrainScales whose aim is to understand brain information processing at multiple spatial and temporal scales.

For an agent that interacts with this volatile setting, it is important to react accurately and as quickly as possible. For example, it has already been shown that when a random sequence of directions of motion to the right or left of a visual target is suddenly biased to one direction, human observers adapt to accurately anticipate it with their eye movements. Here, we prove that this ability extends to a volatile environment where probability biases could change at random switching times. In addition, we also recorded the level of confidence reported by human observers. These results were compared to those of a probabilistic agent that is optimal in relation to the event switching generating model. Compared to other models such as the leaky integrator, we found a better match between the behavioral response observed and that given by this agent. Furthermore, we were also able to fit the experimental data with different levels of switching volatility in the model and derive a common marker for the inter-variability of participants, by titrating their level of preference between exploration and exploitation. Such results prove that in such an unstable environment, human observers can still effectively represent an internal belief, and use this representation in their sensory-motor control system and for explicit judgments. This work offers an innovative approach to more generically test human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.","tags":null,"title":"Should I stay or should I go?

(Lyon, France), Mladenovic J. (Lyon, France), Frey J. (Bordeaux, France)3, Joffily M. (Lyon, France), Maby E. (Lyon, France), Lotte F. (Lyon, France)  Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) devices bypass natural pathways to connect the brain with a machine, directly. They may rely on invasive or non-invasive measures of brain activity and applications cover a large domain, mostly but not restricted to clinical ones. A major objective is to restore communication and autonomy in heavily motor impaired patients. However, no BCI has made its way to a routinely used clinical application yet. One lead for improvement is to endow the machine with learning abilities so that it can optimize its decisions and adapt to changes in the user signals over time1. Several approaches have been proposed but a generic framework is still lacking to foster the development of efficient adaptive BCIs2. Initially proposed to model perception, learning and action by the brain, the Active Inference (AI) framework offers great promises in that aim3. It rests on an explicit generative model of the environment. In BCI, from the machine\u0026rsquo;s point of view, brain signals play the role of sensory inputs on which the machine\u0026rsquo;s perception of mental states will be based. Furthermore, the machine builds up decisions and trades between different actions such as: go on observing, deciding to decide, correcting its previous action or moving on. In this talk, I will present an instantiation of AI in the context of the EEG-based P300-speller BCI for communication, showing it can flexibly combine complementary adaptive features pertaining to both perception and action, and yield significant improvements as shown on realistic simulations. We will discuss perspectives to further extend the current model and performance as well as the challenges ahead to implement this framework online.\n Mattout, J.

Adams (London) https://www.professionalabstracts.com/nf2019/iplanner/#/presentation/1398  Adaptive behaviour includes the ability to choose actions that result in advantageous outcomes. It is key to survival and a fundamental function of nervous systems. Active inference (AI) and reinforcement learning (RL) are two influential models of how the brain might achieve this. A key AI parameter is the precision of beliefs about policies. Precision controls the stochasticity of action selection - similar to decision temperature in RL - and is thought to be encoded by striatal dopamine. 75 healthy subjects performed a \u0026lsquo;go/no-go\u0026rsquo; task, and we measured striatal dopamine 2\u0026frasl;3 receptor (D2/3R) availability in a subset of 25 using [11C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography. In behavioural model comparison, RL performed best across the whole group but AI performed best in accurate subjects. D2/3R availability in the limbic striatum correlated with AI policy precision and also with RL irreducible decision \u0026lsquo;noise\u0026rsquo;. Limbic striatal D2/3R availability also correlated with AI Pavlovian prior beliefs - i.e. the respective probabilities of making or withholding actions in rewarding or loss-avoiding contexts - and the RL learning rate. These findings are consistent with the notion that occupancy of inhibitory striatal D2/3Rs controls the variability of action selection.\nS17.3 Principles and psychophysics of active inference in anticipating a dynamic, switching probabilistic bias / Principes et psychophysique de l\u0026rsquo;inférence active dans l´estimation d\u0026rsquo;un biais dynamique et volatile de probabilité  L. Perrinet (Marseille) see more info on this talk  S17.4 Is laziness contagious? A computational approach to attitude alignment / La fainéantise est-elle contagieuse? Une approche computationnelle de l´alignement des attitudes  J. Daunizeau (Paris)  What do people learn from observing others´ attitudes, such as prudence, impatience or laziness? Rather than viewing these attitudes as examples of subjective and biologically entrenched personality traits, we assume that they derive from uncertain (and mostly implicit) beliefs about how to best weigh risks, delays and efforts in ensuing cost-benefit trade-offs. In this view, it is adaptive to update one´s belief after having observed others´ attitude, which provides valuable information regarding how to best behave in related difficult decision contexts. This is the starting point of our bayesian model of attitude alignment, which we derive in the light of recent neuroimaging findings. First, we disclose a few non-trivial predictions from this model. Second, we validate these predictions experimentally by profiling people´s prudence, impatience and laziness both before and after guessing a series of cost-benefit arbitrages performed by calibrated artificial agents (which are impersonating human individuals). Third, we extend these findings and assess attitude alignment in autistic individuals. Finally, we discuss the relevance and implications of this work, with a particular emphasis on the assessment of biases of social cognition.\nS17.5 Generative Bayesian modeling for causal inference between neural activity and behavior in Drosophila larva  C. Barre (Paris) (TBC)  A fundamental property of the central nervous system is its ability to select appropriate behavioral patterns or sequences of behavioral patterns in response to sensory cues, but what are the biological mechanisms underlying decision making? The Drosophila larva is an ideal animal model for reverse-engineering the neural processes underlying behavior. The full connectome of the larva brain has been imaged at the individual-synapse level using electron microscopy. The host of genetic techniques available for Drosophila allows us to optogenetically manipulate over 1,500 of its roughly 12,000 neurons individually in freely behaving larvae. This enables us to establish causal relationships between neural activity, and behavior at the fundamental level of individual neurons and neural connections. We have access to video record of the individual behavior of ~3,000,000 larvae. We have identified 6 stereotypical behavioral patterns using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The behavioral identified for the larva: crawl, turn, stop, crawl backward, hunch (retract the head), and roll (lateral slide). Each realization of a behavioral pattern is characterized by a different duration, amplitude, and velocity. Here we present a generative model that extracts the behavior of wildtype larvae using Bayesian inference, and interprets behavioral changes following neuron activation or inactivation from large-scale experimental screens. Fig. shows the average behavior of 10,000 larvae over time in a screen where a single neuron is activated at t=30s. A clear change in behavior is seen following activation is seen which is well captured by the model, illustrating its accuracy. The generative model enables us to robustly detect behavioral modifications as significant deviations of the patterns in the larvae\u0026rsquo;s sequence of activities from their equilibrium behavior.\nNeuroFrance: Marseille, capitale des neurosciences Du 22 au 24 mai 2019 au Palais des congrès de Marseille (Parc Chanot), près de 1300 chercheurs, cliniciens et étudiants venus du monde entier partageront leurs travaux lors de NeuroFrance 2019, colloque international organisé par la Société des Neurosciences.Au total, 8 conférences plénières, 42 symposiums, 6 sessions spécialisées, 525 communications affichées, ainsi qu’une exposition avec 42 entreprises et sociétés de biotechnologies, feront de ce colloque un moment exceptionnel pour mettre en lumière les avancées majeures scientifiques et technologiques sur le fonctionnement du cerveau.

Computer vision systems widely rely on artificial intelligence and especially neural network based machine learning, which recently gained huge visibility. The training stage for deep convolutional neural networks is time-consuming and yields enormous energy consumption. In contrast, the human brain has the ability to perform visual tasks with unrivaled computational and energy efficiency. It is believed that one major factor of this efficiency is the fact that information is vastly represented by short pulses (spikes) at analog –not discrete– times. However, computer vision algorithms using such representation still lack in practice, and its high potential is largely underexploited. Inspired from biology, the project addresses the scientific question of developing a low-power, end-to-end analog sensing and processing architecture. This will be applied on the particular context of a field programmable analog array (FPAA) applied to a stereovision system dedicated to coastal surveillance using an aerial robot of 3D visual scenes, running on analog devices, without a central clock and to validate them in real-life situations. The ambitious long-term vision of the project is to develop the next generation AI paradigm that will at term compete with deep learning. We believe that neuromorphic computing, mainly studied in EU countries, will be a key technology in the next decade. It is therefore both a scientific and strategic challenge for France and EU to foster this technological breakthrough. This call will help kickstart collaboration within this European consortium to help leverage the chance to successfully apply to future large-scale grant proposals (e.g. ANR, CHIST-ERA, ERC).\n Get more information.

For an agent interacting with this kind of volatile environment, it is important to respond to such switches accurately and with the shortest delay. However, this operation has in general to be performed in presence of noisy sensory inputs and solely based on the accumulated information. It has already been shown that human observers can accurately anticipate the motion direction of a visual target with their eye movements when this random sequence of rightward/leftward motions is defined by a bias in direction probability. Here, we generalized the capacity of these observers to anticipate different random biases within random-length contextual blocks. Experimental results were compared to those of a probabilistic agent which is optimal with respect to this switching model. We found a better fit between the behaviorally observed anticipatory response with that of the probabilistic agent compared to other models such as a leaky integrator model. Moreover, we could similarly fit the level of confidence reported by human observers with that provided by the model and derive a common marker for subject inter-variability, titrating their level of preference between exploration and exploitation. Such results provide evidence that in such a volatile environment human observers may still efficiently represent an internal belief, along with its precision, and use this representation for sensorimotor control as well as for explicit judgments. This work proposes a novel approach to more generically test human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.","tags":null,"title":"Should I stay or should I go?

However, it remains unclear precisely why the response of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to simple artificial stimuli does not predict their response to complex, naturalistic stimuli. To explore this topic, we use Motion Clouds (MC), which are synthetic textures that preserve properties of natural images and are merely parameterized, in particular by modulating the spatiotemporal spectrum complexity of the stimulus by adjusting the frequency bandwidths. By stimulating the retina of the diurnal rodent, Octodon degus with MC we show that the RGCs respond to increasingly complex stimuli by narrowing their adjustment curves in response to movement. At the level of the population, complex stimuli produce a sparser code while preserving movement information; therefore, the stimuli are encoded more efficiently. Interestingly, these properties were observed throughout different populations of RGCs. Thus, our results reveal that the response at the level of RGCs is modulated by the naturalness of the stimulus - in particular for motion - which suggests that the tuning to the statistics of natural images already emerges at the level of the retina.","tags":["motion detection","motion-clouds","Retina"],"title":"Speed-Selectivity in Retinal Ganglion Cells is Sharpened by Broad Spatial Frequency, Naturalistic Stimuli","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":" previous talk @ LAW, Lyon previous talk @ INVIBE FEST, Paris previous talk @ Brain workshop, Marseille next talk @ CAUSAL Kick-off, Marseille  ","date":1547804700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554204394,"objectID":"0416104d85ade3e818f62ef79567df23","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2019-01-18-laconeu/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-01-18-laconeu/","section":"talk","summary":" previous talk @ LAW, Lyon previous talk @ INVIBE FEST, Paris previous talk @ Brain workshop, Marseille next talk @ CAUSAL Kick-off, Marseille  ","tags":null,"title":"Should I stay or should I go?

Orientation selectivity allows the segmentation of objects in natural visual scenes, which is the first step in building integrative representations from retinal inputs. As such, V1 has always been of central interest in creating artificial neural networks and the recent years have seen a growing interest in the creation of explainable yet robust and adaptive models of cortical visual processes, for fundamental or applied purposes. One notable challenge for those models is to behave reliably in generic natural environments, where information is usually hidden in noise, while most models are typically studied with oriented gratings. Here we show that a simple biologically inspired neural network accounts for orientation selectivity to natural-like textures in the cat's primary visual cortex. Our spiking neural network (SNN) is made of point neurons organized in recurrent and hierarchical layers based on the structure of cortical layers IV and II/III. We found that Spike-timing plasticity and synaptic recurrence allowed the SNN to self-organize its connections weights and reproduce the activity of neurons recorded with laminar probes in cortical areas 17 and 18 of cats, notably orientation tuning responses. After less than 5 seconds of stimulus presentation, the SNN displays narrow orientation selectivity (bandwidth = 10$,^∘$) characteristic of sparse representations, removes noise from the input and learns the structure of natural pattern repetitions. Our results support the use of natural stimuli to study theoretical and experimental cortical dynamics. Furthermore, this model encourages using SNNs to reduce complexity in cortical networks as a method to understand the separate contribution of different components in the laminar organization of the cortex. From an applied perspective, the computations this network performs could also be used as an alternative to classical blackbox Deep Learning models used in artificial vision.","tags":null,"title":"Orientation selectivity to synthetic natural patterns in a cortical-like model of the cat primary visual cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Boutin","Angelo Franciosini","Franck Ruffier","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546297200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560787658,"objectID":"ce317f92b3a8cf8c6e507a61024eff83","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/boutin-franciosini-ruffier-perrinet-19-sfn/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/boutin-franciosini-ruffier-perrinet-19-sfn/","section":"publication","summary":"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are popular to model object recognition in the brain. They offer a flexible and convenient framework to model the hierarchical stacking of cortical areas that compose the Visual Ventral Stream. However, CNN suffers from major drawbacks in comparison with realistic models of biological vision. First, CNN are mostly feedforward and cannot account for the recurrent processing that takes place in the visual cortex. Second, the back-propagation rule used to train CNN involves global learning rules unlikely to be implemented in the brain. Third, the representation generated by CNN are most often dense whereas those generated by the visual cortex are sparse.  To address these problems we propose a new model called Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC). The SDPC framework takes advantage of the Predictive Coding (PC) theory to model the dynamic update scheme observed in the visual cortex. PC suggests, among other scenarios, that feedback connections from a higher cortical area carry neural predictions to the lower cortical area, while the feedforward connections propagates the unpredicted information (or prediction error) to the higher area. As such, the neuronal state of a layer is recursively updated towards minimized prediction error. Interestingly, PC approximates the CNN back-propagation into a local learning rule that is assimilable to a biologically realistic Hebbian learning rule. Last but not least, PC includes a local competition mechanism between neurons that performs an `explaining away' strategy thought sparse coding. The SDPC offers a hierarchical and convolutional implementation of the PC theory.  We experimentally assess the SDPC model using two different image databases. First, we quantify how well the SDPC is untangling the visual information contained in the MNIST database (handwritten digits) under normal and noisy condition. To do so, we train a simple linear classifier to recognize SDPC representation, and we assess the classification accuracy with different level of perturbation. Our results show that the SDPC compete with similar state-of-the-art model in term of classification accuracy and noise robustness. Second, we point out the qualitative similarities between the biological Receptive Fields (RFs) of the early visual cortex and the features learnt by the SDPC model on a face database (AT\u0026T).  As a result the SDPC model accounts both for high level behavioral observation (recognition under noisy and normal environment) and electrophysiological results (Gabor-like RFs).","tags":null,"title":"Sparse Deep Predictive Coding To Model Visual Object Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Vacher","Andrew Isaac Meso","Laurent U Perrinet","Gabriel Peyré"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542754800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293228,"objectID":"0cc2b9c7c446eae0899fbb1ae3f80308","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/vacher-16/","publishdate":"2018-11-21T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/vacher-16/","section":"publication","summary":"A common practice to account for psychophysical biases in vision is to frame them as consequences of a dynamic process relying on optimal inference with respect to a generative model. The present study details the complete formulation of such a gen-erative model intended to probe visual motion perception. It is first derived in a set of axiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility. We then extend previous con-tributions by detailing three equivalent formulations of the Gaussian dynamic texture model. First, the composite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggrega-tion of warped patterns, which can be viewed as 3D Gaussian fields. Second, these textures are cast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation (sPDE). This essential step enables real time, on-the-fly, texture synthesis using time-discretized auto-regressive processes. It also allows for the derivation of a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the log-likelihood of the probability density. The log-likelihoods are finally essential for the construction of a Bayesian inference framework. We use the model to probe speed perception in humans psychophysically using zoom-like changes in stimulus spatial frequency content. The likelihood is contained within the genera-tive model and we chose a slow speed prior consistent with previous literature. We then validated the fitting process of the model using synthesized data. The human data replicates previous findings that relative perceived speed is positively biased by spatial frequency increments. The effect cannot be fully accounted for by previous models, but the current prior acting on the spatio-temporal likelihoods has proved necessary in accounting for the perceptual bias.","tags":["Bayesian model","motion detection","motion-clouds","Psychophysics"],"title":"Bayesian Modeling of Motion Perception using Dynamical Stochastic Textures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean-Bernard Damasse","Laurent U Perrinet","Laurent Madelain","Anna Montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538344800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"26b8a2fc0cacfa12844d3cc81e66a163","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/damasse-18/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/damasse-18/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["eye movements"],"title":"Reinforcement effects in anticipatory smooth eye movements","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550529484,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","Chloé Pasturel","Anna Montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":" previous talk @ LAW, Lyon previous talk @ INVIBE FEST, Paris next talk @ LACONEU, Chile next talk @ CAUSAL Kick-off, Marseille  ","date":1522929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557398529,"objectID":"839508cf4cbdeb199d2539fcb76ababe","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2018-04-05-bcp-talk/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-04-05-bcp-talk/","section":"talk","summary":" previous talk @ LAW, Lyon previous talk @ INVIBE FEST, Paris next talk @ LACONEU, Chile next talk @ CAUSAL Kick-off, Marseille  ","tags":null,"title":"Principles and psychophysics of Active Inference in anticipating a dynamic, switching probabilistic bias","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522062000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"fa7c6aef44d8cdf7b8a3bccd2850f603","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2018-03-26-cours-neuro-comp-fep/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-03-26-cours-neuro-comp-fep/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Probabilities, Bayes and the Free-energy principle","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","Chloé Pasturel","Anna Montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":" previous talk @ LAW, Lyon next talk @ Brain workshop, Marseille next talk @ LACONEU, Chile next talk @ CAUSAL Kick-off, Marseille  ","date":1517439600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554204394,"objectID":"4e8bf1408568147693b31da10683e0c8","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2018-02-01-bcp-invibe-fest/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-02-01-bcp-invibe-fest/","section":"talk","summary":" previous talk @ LAW, Lyon next talk @ Brain workshop, Marseille next talk @ LACONEU, Chile next talk @ CAUSAL Kick-off, Marseille  ","tags":null,"title":"Estimating and anticipating a dynamic probabilistic bias in visual motion direction","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","Etienne Rey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"6c5991b7ec7db2470e754d0f4bca4833","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2018-01-25-meetup-neuronautes/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-01-25-meetup-neuronautes/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Biologically Inspired Computer vision"],"title":"Expériences autour de la perception de la forme en art et science","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557397598,"objectID":"6573bf2d6c2a5a33ed3f6a53d2948ff9","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-18-gdr/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-18-gdr/","section":"publication","summary":"Recording eye movements is a technique that attracts an increasing number of scientists, but also in the general public. Indeed, this allows to quantitatively measure a number of useful dimensions of perception and behavior in general. However, most existing trackers rely on expensive or technically complex solutions. Here, we propose a simple framework to record eye movements using any camera, such as a webcam. As a proof of concept, the recorded image is processed in real-time to detect from a simple sub-set of eye movements : left, center, right or blink. The processing is based on two stages. First, we use a pre-trained computer vision algorithm to extract the image of the face. Second, we used a classical deep-learning architecture to learn to classify these sub-images. This network is a 3 layered convolutional neural network, for which we optimized performance as measured by the accuracy with cross-validation on a wide range of the network's hyper-parameters. Over a dataset of more than 1000 images, this network achieves an average accuracy of approximately 97%. We also provide with an integration with the psychopy library which shows that frames can be processed on a standard laptop at a rate of approximately 25Hz.","tags":["motion anticipation"],"title":"A low-cost, accessible eye tracking framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chloé Pasturel","Anna Montagnini","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557397598,"objectID":"7a0358a28d771c41f8d83c636f1103d3","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/pasturel-18-anemo/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pasturel-18-anemo/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["motion anticipation"],"title":"ANEMO: Quantitative tools for the ANalysis of Eye MOvements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","Chloé Pasturel","Anna Montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557397598,"objectID":"f6c68beb1b5da8bb5034d852976f029d","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/pasturel-18-grenoble/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pasturel-18-grenoble/","section":"publication","summary":"Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combination of saccades and smooth eye  movements.

During the development of primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals, for example, one may observe the emergence of cells selective to localized and oriented features. This leads to the development of a rough contour-based representation of the retinal image in area V1. We modeled the formation of this representation along the thalamo-cortical pathway using a sparse unsupervised learning algorithm in a hierarchical network. This algorithm alternates (i) a coding phase to encode the information and (ii) a learning phase to find the proper encoder (also called dictionary). We replicated and adapted the Multi-Layer Convolutional Sparse Coding (ML-CSC) model from Michael Elad's group~i̧teSulam2017. As an application, we have trained our implementation on a database containing images from faces. The extracted features show similarities with some of the neuron's receptive field found in V1 and beyond. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the potential application of such a strategy to the fast classification of images, for example in hierarchical and dynamical architectures.","tags":["sparse coding"],"title":"From biological vision to unsupervised hierarchical sparse coding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julien Dupeyroux","Victor Boutin","Julien R Serres","Laurent U Perrinet","Stéphane Viollet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293890,"objectID":"559cfb037bc9509a1596fe0097482e4a","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/dupeyroux-boutin-serres-perrinet-viollet-18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dupeyroux-boutin-serres-perrinet-viollet-18/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents for the first time the embedded stand-alone version of the bio-inspired M2APix (Michaelis-Menten auto-adaptive pixels) sensor as a ventral optic flow sensor to endow glider-type unmanned aerial vehicles with autonomous landing ability.

In particular, neurons of the primary visual cortex are anatomically grouped by their preference to a given oriented visual stimulus. Interactions between such groups of neurons have been successfully modeled using recurrently-connected network of spiking neurons, so called \\\"ring models\\\". Nonetheless, this selectivity is most often studied with crystal-like patterns such as gratings. Here, we studied the ability of human observers to discriminate texture-like patterns for which we could quantitatively tune the precision of their oriented content and we propose a generic model to explain such results. The first contribution shows that the discrimination threshold as a function of the precision did not vary smoothly as would be expected, but more in a binary, \\\"all or none\\\" fashion. Our second contribution is to propose a novel model of orientation selectivity that is based on deep-learning techniques, which performance we evaluated in the same task.

We addressed this question by manipulating local speed variability distribution (i. e. speed bandwidth) using a well-controlled class of broadband random-texture stimuli called Motion Clouds (MCs) with continuous naturalistic spatiotemporal frequency spectra (Sanz-Leon et al., 2012, ; Simoncini et al., 2012). In a first 2AFC experiment on speed discrimination, participants had to compare the speed of a broad speed bandwidth MC (range: 0.05-8$,^∘$/s) moving at 1 of 5 possible mean speeds (ranging from 5 to 13 $,^∘$/s) to that of another MC with a small speed bandwidth (SD: 0.05 $,^∘$/s), always moving at a mean speed of 10$,^∘$/s . We found that MCs with larger speed bandwidth (between 0.05-0.5$,^∘$/s) were perceived moving faster. Within this range, speed uncertainty results in over-estimating stimulus velocity. However, beyond a critical bandwidth (SD: 0.5 $,^∘$/s), perception of a coherent speed was lost. In a second 2AFC experiment on direction discrimination, participants had to estimate the motion direction of moving MCs with different speed bandwidths. We found that for large band MCs participant could no longer discriminate motion direction. These results suggest that when increasing speed bandwidth from small to large range, the observer experiences different perceptual regimes. We then decided to run a Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (Knoblauch \u0026 Maloney, 2008) experiment with our speed bandwidth stimuli to investigate these different possible perceptual regimes. We identified three regimes within this space that correspond to motion coherency, motion transparency and motion incoherency. These results allow to further characterize the shape of the interactions kernel observed between different speed tuned channels and different spatiotemporal scales (Gekas et al ., 2017) that underlies global velocity estimation.","tags":null,"title":"Speed uncertainty and motion perception with naturalistic random textures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor Boutin","Franck Ruffier","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1511524800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"011aba6e7c12aacce6e65b1a90b2ceae","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2017-11-24-neurosciences-robotique/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-11-24-neurosciences-robotique/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["sparse coding"],"title":"Unsupervised learning applied to robotic vision","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510747200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"245a573fb4b294b4a9ab406b3ab75468","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2017-11-15-colloque-master/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-11-15-colloque-master/","section":"talk","summary":"This seminar is an exercise to introduce the AMU masters into the format of international conferences.

When a visual stimulus moves along a continuous trajectory, it may be seen ahead of its veridical position with respect to an unpredictable event such as a punctuate flash. This illusion tells us something important about the visual system: contrary to classical computers, neural activity travels at a relatively slow speed. It is largely accepted that the resulting delays cause this perceived spatial lag of the flash. Still, after several decades of debates, there is no consensus regarding the underlying mechanisms.   Researchers from the Timone Institute of Neurosciences bring a new theoretical hypothesis on a visual illusion discovered at the beginning of the 20th century. This illusion remained misunderstood while it poses fundamental questions about how our brains represent events in space and time. This study published on January 26, 2017 in the journal PLOS Computational Biology, shows that the solution lies in the predictive mechanisms intrinsic to the neural processing of information. New Research: The Flash-Lag Effect as a Motion-Based Predictive Shift https://t.co/K3KWPO8l4a Khoei et al. #vision #motion #neuralnetworks pic.twitter.com/RElm4Qqo58\n\u0026mdash; PLOS Comp Biol (@PLOSCompBiol) February 8, 2017  Visual illusions are still popular: in a quasi-magical way, they can make objects appear where they are not expected\u0026hellip; They are also excellent opportunities to question the constraints of our perceptual system. Many illusions are based on motion, such as the flash-lag effect. Observe a luminous dot that moves along a rectilinear trajectory. If a second light dot is flashed very briefly just above the first, the moving point will always be perceived in front of the flash while they are vertically aligned.  Fig 2. Diagonal Markov chain. In the current study, the estimated state vector z = {x, y, u, v} is composed of the 2D position (x and y) and velocity (u and v) of a (moving) stimulus. (A) First, we extend a classical Markov chain using Nijhawan’s diagonal model in order to take into account the known neural delay τ: At time t, information is integrated until time t − τ, using a Markov chain and a model of state transitions p(zt|zt−δt) such that one can infer the state until the last accessible information p(zt−τ|I0:t−τ). This information can then be “pushed” forward in time by predicting its trajectory from t − τ to t. In particular p(zt|I0:t−τ) can be predicted by the same internal model by using the state transition at the time scale of the delay, that is, p(zt|zt−τ). This is virtually equivalent to a motion extrapolation model but without sensory measurements during the time window between t − τ and t. Note that both predictions in this model are based on the same model of state transitions. (B) One can write a second, equivalent “pull” mode for the diagonal model. Now, the current state is directly estimated based on a Markov chain on the sequence of delayed estimations. While being equivalent to the push-mode described above, such a direct computation allows to more easily combine information from areas with different delays. Such a model implements Nijhawan’s “diagonal model”, but now motion information is probabilistic and therefore, inferred motion may be modulated by the respective precisions of the sensory and internal representations. \u0026copy; Such a diagonal delay compensation can be demonstrated in a two-layered neural network including a source (input) and a target (predictive) layer [44]. The source layer receives the delayed sensory information and encodes both position and velocity topographically within the different retinotopic maps of each layer. For the sake of simplicity, we illustrate only one 2D map of the motions (x, v). The integration of coherent information can either be done in the source layer (push mode) or in the target layer (pull mode). Crucially, to implement a delay compensation in this motion-based prediction model, one may simply connect each source neuron to a predictive neuron corresponding to the corrected position of stimulus (x + v ⋅ τ, v) in the target layer. The precision of this anisotropic connectivity map can be tuned by the width of convergence from the source to the target populations. Using such a simple mapping, we have previously shown that the neuronal population activity can infer the current position along the trajectory despite the existence of neural delays.   Processing visual information takes time and even if these delays are remarkably short, they are not negligible and the nervous system must compensate them. For an object that moves predictably, the neural network can infer its most probable position taking into account this processing time. For the flash, however, this prediction can not be established because its appearance is unpredictable. Thus, while the two targets are aligned on the retina at the time of the flash, the position of the moving object is anticipated by the brain to compensate for the processing time: it is this differentiated treatment that causes the flash-lag effect. The researchers show that this hypothesis also makes it possible to explain the cases where this illusion does not work: for example if the flash appears at the end of the moving dot\u0026rsquo;s trajectory or if the target reverses its path in an unexpected way. In this work, the major innovation is to use the accuracy of information in the dynamics of the model. Thus, the corrected position of the moving target is calculated by combining the sensory flux with the internal representation of the trajectory, both of which exist in the form of probability distributions. To manipulate the trajectory is to change the precision and therefore the relative weight of these two information when they are optimally combined in order to know where an object is at the present time. The researchers propose to call parodiction (from the ancient Greek paron, the present) this new theory that joins Bayesian inference with taking into account neuronal delays.  Fig 5. Histogram of the estimated positions as a function of time for the dMBP model. Histograms of the inferred horizontal positions (blueish bottom panel) and horizontal velocity (reddish top panel), as a function of time frame, from the dMBP model. Darker levels correspond to higher probabilities, while a light color corresponds to an unlikely estimation. We highlight three successive epochs along the trajectory, corresponding to the flash initiated, standard (mid-point) and flash terminated cycles. The timing of the flashes are respectively indicated by the dashed vertical lines. In dark, the physical time and in green the delayed input knowing τ = 100 ms. Histograms are plotted at two different levels of our model in the push mode. The left-hand column illustrates the source layer that corresponds to the integration of delayed sensory information, including the prior on motion. The right-hand illustrates the target layer corresponding to the same information but after the occurrence of some motion extrapolation compensating for the known neural delay τ.   Despite the simplicity of this solution, parodiction has elements that may seem counter-intuitive. Indeed, in this model, the physical world is considered \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo;, that is to say, it can only be guessed by our sensations and our experience. The role of visual perception is then to deliver to our central nervous system the most likely information despite the different sources of noise, ambiguity and time delays. According to the authors of this publication, the visual treatment would consist in a \u0026ldquo;simulation\u0026rdquo; of the visual world projected at the present time, even before the visual information can actually modulate, confirm or cancel this simulation. This hypothesis, which seems to belong to \u0026ldquo;science fiction\u0026rdquo;, is being tested with more detailed and biologically plausible hierarchical neural network models that should allow us to better understand the mysteries underlying our perception.

In contrast, living organisms are remarkably able to track and intercept moving objects under a large range of challenging environmental conditions. Physiological, behavioral and psychophysical evidences strongly suggest that position coding is extrapolated using an explicit and reliable representation of object's motion but it is still unclear how these two representations interact. For instance, the so-called flash-lag effect supports the idea of a differential processing of position between moving and static objects. Although elucidating such mechanisms is crucial in our understanding of the dynamics of visual processing, a theory is still missing to explain the different facets of this visual illusion. Here, we reconsider several of the key aspects of the flash-lag effect in order to explore the role of motion upon neural coding of objects' position. First, we formalize the problem using a Bayesian modeling framework which includes a graded representation of the degree of belief about visual motion. We introduce a motion-based prediction model as a candidate explanation for the perception of coherent motion. By including the knowledge of a fixed delay, we can model the dynamics of sensory information integration by extrapolating the information acquired at previous instants in time. Next, we simulate the optimal estimation of object position with and without delay compensation and compared it with human perception under a broad range of different psychophysical conditions. Our computational study suggests that the explicit, probabilistic representation of velocity information is crucial in explaining position coding, and therefore the flash-lag effect. We discuss these theoretical results in light of the putative corrective mechanisms that can be used to cancel out the detrimental effects of neural delays and illuminate the more general question of the dynamical representation of spatial information at the present time in the visual pathways.","tags":["Bayesian model","motion prediction"],"title":"The flash-lag effect as a motion-based predictive shift","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1484905500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"a823b73a1499766ad4e4c538151477c3","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2017-01-20-laconeu/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-01-20-laconeu/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tutorial: Active inference for eye movements: Bayesian methods, neural inference, dynamics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1484819100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"16849b832a320a43870b886e3417b0d4","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2017-01-19-laconeu/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-01-19-laconeu/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Biologically Inspired Computer vision"],"title":"Tutorial: Sparse optimization in neural computations","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1484726400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"b5b2261e3d5e714f398d8b91f9719733","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2017-01-18-laconeu/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-01-18-laconeu/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Back to the present: how neurons deal with delays","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Victor Boutin","Franck Ruffier","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":" This work is a followup of Perrinet, 2010, Neural Computation the poster (PDF) will be presented Thursday, May 18 @ NeuroFrance, Bordeaux. see a follow-up publication on BoutinRuffierPerrinet17spars  ","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551652743,"objectID":"3e557550f0b6b8354cc084b48365d19f","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/boutin-ruffier-perrinet-17-neurofrance/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/boutin-ruffier-perrinet-17-neurofrance/","section":"publication","summary":"One core advantage of sparse representations is the efficient coding of complex signals using compact codes.

Motion processing in the context of complex, natural images is less known. We have previously investigated the human ocular following responses to a novel class of random texture stimuli of parameterized naturalistic statistics: the Motion Clouds. In Fourier space, these dynamical textures are designed with a log normal distribution of spatial frequencies power multiplied by a pink noise power spectral density that reduces the high frequency contents of the stimulus (Sanz-Leon et al. 2011). We have previously shown that the precision of reflexive tracking increases with the spatial frequency bandwidth of large ( 30◦ diameter) patterns (i.e. the width of the spatial frequency distribution around a given mean spatial frequency; Simoncini et al. 2012). Now, we extend this approach to voluntary tracking and focused on the effects of spatial frequency bandwidth upon the initial phase of smooth pursuit eye movements. Participants were instructed to pursue a large patch of moving clouds (mean speeds: 5, 10 or 20◦/s) embedded within a smoothing Gaussian window of standard deviation 5◦. The motion stimuli were presented with four different spatial frequency band- widths and two different mean spatial frequencies (0.3 and 1 cpd). We observed that smaller bandwidth textures exhibit a stronger spectral energy within the low spatial frequency range (below 1cpd), yielding to shorter latency of smooth pursuit eye movements. A weak and less consistent effect was found on initial eye acceleration, contrary what was previously observed with OFR. After 400ms, the steady-state tracking velocity matched the mean visual motion speed and pursuit performance was comparable with that observed with a control, small dot motion. Motion Clouds offer an efficient tool to probe the optimal window of visibility for human smooth pursuit through the manipulation of both the mean and the variability of spatial frequency.","tags":["eye movements","motion detection","motion-clouds"],"title":"Voluntary tracking the moving clouds : Effects of speed variability on human smooth pursuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cesar U Ravello","Maria-José Escobar","Adrián G Palacios","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1479337200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560787216,"objectID":"0a50e0e556c2bbe845d4b751e803c9a5","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/ravello-16-droplets/","publishdate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ravello-16-droplets/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Biologically Inspired Computer vision","Image texture","Retina","sparse coding"],"title":"Differential response of the retinal neural code with respect to the sparseness of natural images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":" Based on Perrinet et al, 2012 and Khoei et al, 2013 See a followup in Khoei et al, 2017  ","date":1478174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558954465,"objectID":"a21afa2114711607d191aa6dd6e579f6","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2016-11-03-sigma/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-11-03-sigma/","section":"talk","summary":" Based on Perrinet et al, 2012 and Khoei et al, 2013 See a followup in Khoei et al, 2017  ","tags":null,"title":"The flash-lag effect as a motion-based predictive shift","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jean-Bernard Damasse","Laurent U Perrinet","Jeremie Jozefowiez","Laurent Madelain","Anna Montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1478127600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"7a4b4cda2e35089fa388c7bb5bb5f8a4","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2016-11-03-gdr/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-11-03-gdr/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reinforcement contingencies modulate anticipatory smooth eye movements","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477479600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"b5d9424071f3a6b742d8b48c868a9d9e","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2016-10-26-perrinet-16-euvip/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-10-26-perrinet-16-euvip/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Biologically Inspired Computer vision"],"title":"Biologically-inspired characterization of sparseness in natural images","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Lionel Fillatre","Michel Barlaud","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":" See a followup in Perrinet and Bednar, 2015  ","date":1477479600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558952883,"objectID":"59929f1297bfcec1f03b17a14bc8b53a","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2016-10-26-fillatre-barlaud-perrinet-16-euvip/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-10-26-fillatre-barlaud-perrinet-16-euvip/","section":"talk","summary":" See a followup in Perrinet and Bednar, 2015  ","tags":["Biologically Inspired Computer vision"],"title":"Categorization of microscopy images using a biologically inspired edge co-occurrences descriptor","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1476655200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560787216,"objectID":"7086ec2f451d080124c1424ed13c5705","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-16-euvip/","publishdate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-16-euvip/","section":"publication","summary":"Natural images follow statistics inherited by the structure of our physical (visual) environment.

Over the last half-century the mechanism for OS has been hotly debated. However the theories that purport to explain OS have almost all considered cortical networks in which the neurons receive input preferentially from cells with similar PO. Such theories certainly capture the connectivity for neurons in orientation domains where neurons are surrounded by other cells with similar PO. However this does not necessarily hold near pinwheels: because of the discontinuous change in orientation preference at the pinwheel, neurons in this area are surrounded by cells of all preferred orientations. Thus if the probability of connection is solely dependent on anatomical distance, the inputs that these neurons receive should represent all orientations by roughly the same amount. Thus one may expect that the response of the cells near pinwheels should hardly vary with orientation, in contrast to experimental data. As a result, the common belief is that, at least near pinwheels, the connectivity depends also on the differences between preferred orientation. The situation near pinwheels in V1 of carnivores and primates is similar to that in the whole of V1 of rodents. In these species, neurons in V1 are OS but the network does not exhibit an orientation map and the surround of the cells represents all orientations roughly equally. In a recent theoretical paper (Hansel and van Vreeswijk 2012) we have demonstrated that in this situation, the response of the cells can still be orientation selective provided that the network operates in the balanced regime. Here we hypothesize that V1 with an orientation map operates in the balanced regime and therefore neurons can exhibit OS near pinwheels even in the absence of functional specific connectivity. The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to investigate whether the “balance hypothesis” holds for layer 2\u0026frasl;3 in V1 of primate and carnivore and whether the functional organization observed in that layer can be accounted for without feature specific connectivity. We will combine modeling and experiments to investigate how the response of the neurons – the mean firing, the mean voltage, the inhibitory and excitatory conductances and importantly, the power spectrum of their fluctuations – vary with the location in the map, and also how a population of neurons – LFP, voltage-sensitive dye imaging or 2 photons – is affected by the various para- meters used to test the system. Whether V1 indeed operates in the balanced regime in more realistic conditions will be further investigated by determining how the local network responds to visual stimuli beyond the classical receptive field. We will investigate this issue in models of layer 2\u0026frasl;3 representing multiple hyper- columns to characterize center-surround interactions and their dependence on the long-range connectivity. This will provide us with predictions for center-surround interactions for cells near pinwheels and in orientation domains. These predictions will be tested experimentally.\nThe proposed project is new and ambitious. It aims at building a comprehensive and coherent understand- ing of the physiology of V1 layer 2\u0026frasl;3 on several spatial scales from single cells to several hypercolumns and to account for this in mechanistic models. To accomplish these ambitious aims, we propose a combination of experimental and computational studies that take advantage of the unique strengths and the complementarity of expertise of 3 research teams. The Paris team has extensive experience in large-scale modeling of V1. The Toulouse and Marseille teams master both intra- and extracellular electrophysiology.

We will study how the long-distance \u0026ldquo;horizontal\u0026rdquo; connectivity, intrinsic to V1 and the feedback from higher cortical areas contribute to a dynamic processing of local-to-global features as a function of the context (eg displacement along a trajectory; during reafference change induced by eye-movements\u0026hellip;). We will search to characterize the dynamic processes based on lateral propagation intra-V1, through which spatio-temporal inferences (continuous movement or apparent motion sequences) facilitating spatial (\u0026ldquo;filling-in\u0026rdquo;) or positional (\u0026ldquo;flash-lag\u0026rdquo;) future expected responses may be generated. The project will use a variety of animations of local oriented stimuli forming, according to their spatial and temporal coherence, predictable global patterns, apparent motion sequences and/or continuous trajectories. We will measure the cortical dynamics at two scales of neuronal integration, from micro- (intracellular, SUA) to meso-scopic levels (multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSDI)) in the anesthetized (cat, marmoset) and awake fixating animal (macaca mulata). In a second step, we will combine these multiscale observations to constrain a structuro-functional model of low-level perception, integrating the micro-meso constraints. Two laboratories will participate in synergy to the project: UNIC-Gif (Dir. Yves Frégnac, DRCE2 CNRS, coordinator) and INT-Marseille (NeOpTo Team Dir. Frederic Chavane, DR2 CNRS).\nWP3 - Design of novel visual paradigms, probabilistic model of V1 and data-driven simulations - co lead UNIC-INT. Objectives : This WP will have two primary goals. The first one is theoretically driven, and for sake of simplicity will ignore the dynamic features of neural integration (as expected from a statistical model of image analysis). Binding the different features of visual objects at the local scale (contours) as well as a more global level involves understanding the statistical regularities of the sensory inflow. In particular, titrating the predictions that can be done at the statistical level can be seen as a first pass to better search for critical parameters constraining the network behaviour. From these, we will build probabilistic predictive models optimized for edge co-occurrence classification and generate novel visual statistics 1) which obey rules imposed by the functional horizontal connectivity anisotropies, such as co- circularity, and 2) which facilitate binding in the orientation domain, such as log-polar planforms. These statistics generated in the first half of the grant will be implemented and tested experimentally in the second half of the grant. The second one is more data-driven (as well as phenomenological for feedback from higher cortical areas, since it will not be explored in the grant). Since model fitting will depend on close interactions with WP1 and WP2 measurements, it will be done in the second half of the grant.\nWP3-Task 1: Theoretically oriented workplan – Lead INT (Laurent Perrinet)  WP3-Task 1.1 - theory : we will exploit our current expertise in integrating these statistics in the form of probabilistic models to make predictions both at the physiological and modelling levels. First, we will take advantage of our previous work on the quantification of the association field in different classes of natural images (Perrinet \u0026amp; Bednar, 2015). Using an existing library (https://github.com/bicv/SparseEdges), we will use the sparse representation of static natural images to compute histograms of edge co-occurrences. Using an existing algorithm for unsupervised learning (https://github.com/bicv/SparseHebbianLearning), we will learn the different independent components of edge co-occurrences. Such an algorithm fits well a traditional deep-learning convolutional neural network, but, in addition, will include constraints imposed by intra-layer horizontal connectivity. We expect that relevant features will be co-linear or co-circular pairs of edges, but also T-junctions or end-stopping features.\n WP3-Task 1.2 - image/film synthesis : We have previously found that random synthetic textures, coined \u0026ldquo;Motion Clouds\u0026rdquo;, can be used to quantify V1 implication in visual motion perception (Leon et al, 2012; Simoncini et al, 2012). Recently, the INT and UNIC, partners proved mathematically that these stimuli were optimal with respect to some common geometrical transformations, such as translation, zoom or rotations (Vacher et al, 2015). A main characteristic of these textures is to be generated with a maximally entropic arrangement of elementary textures (so-called textons).\n  ** Informed by the generative model of edge co-occurrences studied in subtask 1, we will be able to extend the family of motion cloud stimuli (Leon et al, 2012; Simoncini et al, 2012) to include joint dependencies between different elements in position or orientation. An exact solution to this problem is hard to achieve as it involves a combinatorial search of all possible combinations of pairs of edges. However, numerous variational approaches are possible and fit well with our probabilistic framework. We will use the convolutional neural network described above but using a back-propagating stream to generate different images. Such a representation will then be optimized using an unsupervised learning method. This is similar to the process used in Generative Adversarial Networks in deep-learning architectures (Radford et al, Archives). ** Finally, the regularities observed in static images will be extended to dynamical scenes by observing that a co-occurrence can be implemented by simple geometrical operations as they are operated in time. For instance a co-circularity is easily described as the set of smooth roto-translational transformations of an edge in time using the group of Galilean transformations (Sarti and Citti, 2006). This theory calls for a first prediction to understand the set of whole possible spatio-temporal co-occurrences of edges as geodesics in the lifted space of all possible trajectories. We predict that such decomposition should allow us to better understand the different classes of features that emerged in the first task. * WP3-Task 1.3 - Feedback of theory on experimentation : An essential aspect of this work would be to apply these stimuli in neurophysiological experiments and in the modelling. In particular, the ability to select different types of dependencies from the different classes learned above (for instance, co-circularities of a certain curvature range) will make it possible to evaluate the relative contribution of different components of the contextual information. This justifies the fact that the WP3 post-doctoral fellow should have the mobility (between INT and UNIC) and multi-disciplinar profile (theoretical and experimental) to perform this task. * WP3-Task 1.4 - Generic modelling : These various subtasks will allow us to determine the hierarchy of critical features relevant to describe the full statistics of the space of spatio-temporal edge co-occurrences. Indeed, in static images, we will be able to find independent component in the histograms of edge co-occurrences between metric aspect (distance or scale between edge) from configurational aspects (difference of angle or co-circularity angle).\nSimilarly, we expect to see that the different independent features should decompose at various scales both in space and in time. For instance, we expect configurational aspects to be more local while aspects related to a motion (Perrinet and Masson, 2012; Khoei et al, 2016) or global shape (form) should be more global. This translates into a probabilistic hierarchical model that would combine dependencies from different cues. In particular, through the emergence of differential pathways for form and motion. These quantitative predictions should finally be confronted at the modelling and neurophysiological levels.\nWP3-Task 2 : Data-driven comprehensive model of V1 – Co-lead UNIC and INT The second task is more data-driven (as well as phenomenological for the feedback circuit part, since largely unknown). Since simulations will depend on close interactions with WP1 and WP2 measurements, it will be developed by the WP3-Post-Doc in the second half of the grant. It will benefit from existing structuro-functional models addressing separately two distinct levels of neural integration, microscopic (conductance-based in Kremkow et al, 2016; Antolik et al, submitted, Chariker et al, 2016) and mesoscopic (VSD-like mean field in Rankin and Chavane, 2017). Efforts will be made to merge these models to fit - in a unified multiscale biologically realistic model - the cellular and VSD data targeting critically horizontal propagation. The parameterization should be flexible enough to produce a generic cortical architecture accounting possibly for species-specificity (Antolik for cat; Chaliker for monkey)\nAcknowledgement This work was supported by ANR project \u0026ldquo;Horizontal-V1\u0026rdquo; N° ANR-17-CE37-0006.\n","date":1461708000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558952883,"objectID":"fbaeaa16be37637152f649b65a613c49","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/project/anr-horizontal-v1/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/anr-horizontal-v1/","section":"project","summary":"ANR Horizontal-V1 (2017/2021): Connectivité Horizontale et Prédiction de Cohérences dans l'Intégration de Contour et Mouvement dans le Cortex Visuel Primaire","tags":["grant","current-grant"],"title":"ANR Horizontal-V1 (2017/2021)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The objectives of PREDICTEYE is to rigorously test and define the functional and neurophysiological grounds of probabilistic oculomotor internal models by investigating the multiple timescales at which the trajectory of a moving target is learned and represented in a probabilistic framework (Aim #1).

Recently the idea that reinforcement may be used to explain learning in motor responses has emerged. In particular, there is a growing interest in studying the effects of reinforcement learning in arm movements trajectories (Dam, Kording, \u0026amp; Wei, 2013), pointing movements (Trommershauser, Landy, \u0026amp; Maloney, 2006), or eye movements (Madelain, Champrenaut, \u0026amp; Chauvin, 2007; Madelain \u0026amp; Krauzlis, 2003b; Madelain, Paeye, \u0026amp; Wallman, 2011; Sugrue, Corrado, \u0026amp; Newsome, 2004; Takikawa, Kawagoe, Itoh, Nakahara, \u0026amp; Hikosaka, 2002; Xu-Wilson, Zee, \u0026amp; Shadmehr, 2009). However, and despite these few seminal studies, much is still unknown about both the details of the effects of reward on motor control and the underlying mechanisms. This proposal aims at a better understanding of how skilled motor responses are learned focusing on voluntary eye movements.\nAlthough learning is often regarded as a restricted period of time during which a behavior undergo some changes we view learning as a continuously ongoing process. In the case of motor control every instance of a behavior is followed by some consequences that will affect some dimensions of the future response. These changes will in return affect the functional relations with the environment and this feedback process continues through lifetime. Therefore we do not regard motor learning as a special phase that allows the emergence of a particular motor response but as a continuous adaptation to the changes within the organism that affect the functional relations with her environment. This distinction is important because the learning situations that are experimentally tested over a short period of time may then be viewed as a condensed version of motor learning in the real life: the same adaptive processes are responsible for the changes in the response in both situations.\nAn important aspect of this fundamental research project is that the theoretical propositions addressed provide a new view on motor learning that departs from conventional wisdom. We expect to gain considerable knowledge on learning by constructing new experimental paradigms to collect behavioural data, implementing new learning models based on Bayesian theories and testing dynamical mathematical models of behavioural changes. Whichever way the results turn out, we anticipate that these studies will provide a better understanding of motor learning and provide a well-defined and solid framework for studying other forms of motor plasticity. If eye movement learning follows the rules of other operant responses (i.e. responses reinforced by their consequences), this will constitute a minor revolution in the study of motor control, both at the behavioral and neural levels, with important implications for the understanding of plasticity in other motor systems.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by ANR project ANR-13-APPR-0008 \u0026quot;ANR R.E.M.\u0026quot;.

Whereas encoding and decoding of direction information is now largely understood in various neuronal systems, how the human brain accurately represents speed information remains largely unknown. Speed tuned neurons have been identified in several early cortical visual areas in monkeys. However, how such speed tuning emerges is not yet understood. A working hypothesis is that speed tuned neurons nonlinearly combine motion information extracted at different spatial and temporal scales, taking advantage of the statistical spatiotemporal properties of natural scenes. However, such pooling of information must be context dependent, varying with the spatial perceptual organization of the visual scenes. Furthermore, the population code underlying perceived speed is not elucidated either and therefore we are still far from understanding how speed information is decoded to drive and control motor responses or perceptual judgments.\nRecently, we have proposed that speed estimation is intrinsically a multi-scale, task-dependent problem (Simoncini et al., Nature Neuroscience 2012) and we have defined a new set of motion stimuli, constructed as random phase dynamical textures that mimic the statistics of natural scenes (Sanz-Leon et al., Journal of Neurophysiology 2012). This approach has proved to be fruitful to investigate nonlinear properties of motion integration.\nThe current proposal brings together psychophysicists, oculomotor scientists and modelers to investigate speed processing in human. We aim at expanding this framework in order to understand how tracking eye movements and motion perception can take advantage of multiple scale processing for estimating target speed. We will design sets of high dimensional stimuli by extending our generative model. Using these natural-statistics stimuli, we will investigate how speed information is encoded by computing motion energy across different spatial and temporal filters. By analysing both perceptual and oculomotor responses we will probe the nonlinear mechanisms underlying the integration of the outputs of multiple spatiotemporal filters and implement these processes in a refined version of our model. Furthermore, we will test our working hypothesis that in natural scenes such nonlinear integration provides precise and reliable motion estimates, which leads to efficient motion-based behaviors. By comparing tracking responses with perception, we will also test a second critical hypothesis, that nonlinear speed computations are task-dependent. In particular, we will explore the extent to which the geometrical structures of visual scenes are decisive for perception beyond the motion energy computation used for early sensorimotor transformation. Finally we will investigate the role of contextual and extra-retinal, predictive information in building an efficient dynamic estimate of objects\u0026rsquo; speed for perception and action.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by ANR project \u0026quot;ANR Speed\u0026quot; ANR-13-BSHS2-0006.

When an object moves across the visual field, the sequence of visited positions is strongly correlated in space and time, forming a trajectory. These correlated images generate a sequence of local activation of the feed-forward stream. Local properties such as position, direction and orientation can be extracted at each time step by a feed-forward cascade of linear filters and static non-linearities. However such local, piecewise, analysis ignores the recent history of motion and faces several difficulties, such as systematic delays, ambiguous information processing (e.g., aperture and correspondence problems61) high sensitivity to noise and segmentation problems when several objects are present. Indeed, two main aspects of visual processing have been largely ignored by the dominant, classical feed-forward scheme. First, natural inputs are often ambiguous, dynamic and non-stationary as, e.g., objects moving along complex trajectories. To process them, the visual system must segment them from the scene, estimate their position and direction over time and predict their future location and velocity. Second, each of these processing steps, from the retina to the highest cortical areas, is implemented by an intricate interplay of feed-forward, feedback and horizontal interactions1. Thus, at each stage, a moving object will not only be processed locally, but also generate a lateral propagation of information. Despite decades of motion processing research, it is still unclear how the early visual system processes motion trajectories. We, among others, have proposed that anisotropic diffusion of motion information in retinotopic maps can contribute resolving many of these difficulties25 13. Under this perspective, motion integration, anticipation and prediction would be jointly achieved through the interactions between feed-forward, lateral and feedback propagations within a common spatial reference frame, the retinotopic maps.\nAddressing this question is particularly challenging, as it requires to probe these sequences of events at multiple scales (from individual cells to large networks) and multiple stages (retina, primary visual cortex (V1)). “TRAJECTORY” proposes such an integrated approach. Using state-of-the-art micro- and mesoscopic recording techniques combined with modeling approaches, we aim at dissecting, for the first time, the population responses at two key stages of visual motion encoding: the retina and V1. Preliminary experiments and previous computational studies demonstrate the feasibility of our work. We plan three coordinated physiology and modeling work-packages aimed to explore two crucial early visual stages in order to answer the following questions: How is a translating bar represented and encoded within a hierarchy of visual networks and for which condition does it elicit anticipatory responses? How is visual processing shaped by the recent history of motion along a more or less predictable trajectory? How much processing happens in V1 as opposed to simply reflecting transformations occurring already in the retina?\nThe project is timely because partners master new tools such as multi-electrode arrays and voltage-sensitive dye imaging for investigating the dynamics of neuronal populations covering a large segment of the motion trajectory, both in retina and V1. Second, it is strategic: motion trajectories are a fundamental aspect of visual processing that is also a technological obstacle in computer vision and neuroprostheses design. Third, this project is unique by proposing to jointly investigate retinal and V1 levels within a single experimental and theoretical framework. Lastly, it is mature being grounded on (i) preliminary data paving the way of the three different aims and (ii) a history of strong interactions between the different groups that have decided to join their efforts.\nThe Marseille team  Frédéric Chavane (DR, CNRS, NEOPTO team) is working in the field of vision research for about 20 years with a special interest in the role of lateral interactions in the integration of sensory input in the primary visual cortex. His recent work suggest that lateral interactions mediated by horizontal intracortical connectivity participates actively in the input normalization that controls a wide range of function, from the contrast-response gain to the representation of illusory or real motion. His expertise range from microscopic (intracellular recordings) to mesoscopic (optical imaging, multi-electrode array) recording scales in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized and awake behaving animals.\n Laurent Perrinet (CR, CNRS, NEOPTO team). His scientific interests focus on bridging computational understanding of neural dynamics and low-level sensory processing by focusing on motion perception. He is the author of papers in machine learning, computational neuroscience and behavioral psychology. One key concept is the use of statistical regularities from natural scenes as a main drive to integrate local neural information into a global understanding of the scene. In a recent paper that he coauthored (in Nature Neuroscience), he developed a method to use synthesized stimuli targeted to analyze physiological data in a system-identification approach.\n Ivo Vanzetta (CR, CNRS, NEOPTO team). His scientific interests focus on how to optimally use photonics-based imaging methods to investigate visual information processing in low-level visual areas, in the anesthetized and awake animal (rodent \u0026amp; primate). As can be seen from his bibliographic record, these methods include optical imaging of intrinsic signals and voltage sensitive dyes and, recently, 2 photon microscopy. Finally I. Vanzetta has an ongoing collaboration with L. Perrinet on the utilization of well-controlled, synthesized nature-like visual stimuli to probe the response characteristics of the primate\u0026rsquo;s visual system (Sanz-Leon \u0026amp; al. 2012).\n  Progress meeting ANR TRAJECTORY  Time January 15th, 2018 Location INT General presentation of the grant, see Anr TRAJECTORY Overview of my current projects https://laurentperrinet.github.io/sciblog/files/2017-11-15_ColloqueMaster.html MotionClouds with trajectories https://laurentperrinet.github.io/sciblog/posts/2018-01-16-testing-more-complex-trajectories.html or https://laurentperrinet.github.io/sciblog/posts/2018-11-13-testing-more-complex-trajectories.html   A predictive sequence is essential in resolving the coherence problem. The sequence in which a set of local motion is shown is essential for the detection of global motion. we replicate here the experiments by Scott Watamaniuk and colleagues. They have shown behaviourally that a dot in noise is much more detectable when it follows a coherent trajectory, up to an order of magnitude of 10 times what would be predicted by the local components of the trajectory. In this movie we observe white noise and at first sight, no information is detectable. In fact, there is a dot moving along some smooth linear trajectory. Since this is compatible with a predictive sequence, it is much easier to see the dot (from left to right in the top of the image, a smooth pursuit helps to catch it). This simple experiment shows that, even if local motion is similar in both movies, a coherent trajectory is more easy to track. Obviously, we may thus conclude that the whole trajectory is more that its individual parts, and that the independence hypothesis does not hold if we want to account for the predictive information in input sequences such as seems to be crucial for the AP.

Moreover, this pseudo-random stimulation protocol allows to make a trial-by-trial analysis locked to the stimulation onset. This allows to study experimentally trial-by-trial variability and relative importance between measurement noise and contextual uncertainty.\nThis is a first step before extending synthesis to probabilistic synthesis models of the texture\u0026rsquo;s geometric structure. The model will use geometrical multi-scale transformations extending the classical wavelet representation. For instance, these transformations synthesize the stimuli as randomized superposition of geometrical wavelets that match the spatio-temporal profile of association fields in V1. These will be implemented by computing evolutions of partial differential equations with randomized initial conditions. Finally, models are designed such that we explicitly tune the statistics of the generative model and thus control the structural complexity of the stimuli, such as different scales of smoothness in the spatio-temporal dynamics as displayed by natural scenes.\n Web-site Source code  ","date":1461708000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550850890,"objectID":"3d8998d7be78d8b825199f2c818fcd22","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/project/motion-clouds/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/motion-clouds/","section":"project","summary":"**MotionClouds** are random dynamic stimuli optimized to study motion perception.","tags":["psychophysics","motion-clouds"],"title":"Motion Clouds","type":"project"},{"authors":["Angelo Franciosini","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":" Description The Ph.D. program in Integrative and Clinical Neuroscience (Aix-Marseille University) is offering in 2017 three Ph.D. scholarships to Master students graduated from highly ranked international universities (outside France).

But the images of the distant horizon and of the sun in the sky lie behind the mirror at a limited distance, equal to its focal length. Between these and the surface of the mirror are found the images of all the other objects before it, but the images are diminished and flattened in proportion to the distance of their objects from the mirror. \u0026hellip; Yet every straight line or plane in the outer world is represented by a straight line or plane in the image. The image of a man measuring with a rule a straight line from the mirror, would contract more and more the farther he went, but with his shrunken rule the man in the image would count out exactly the same results as in the outer world, all lines of sight in the mirror would be represented by straight lines of sight in the mirror. In short, I do not see how men in the mirror are to discover that their bodies are not rigid solids and their experiences good examples of the correctness of Euclidean axioms. But if they could look out upon our world as we look into theirs without overstepping the boundary, they must declare it to be a picture in a spherical mirror, and would speak of us just as we speak of them; and if two inhabitants of the different worlds could communicate with one another, neither, as far as I can see, would be able to convince the other that he had the true, the other the distorted, relation. Indeed I cannot see that such a question would have any meaning at all, so long as mechanical considerations are not mixed up with it.\u0026rdquo; — Hermann von Helmholtz In \u0026lsquo;On the Origin and Significance of Geometrical Axioms,\u0026rdquo; Popular Scientific Lectures\u0026lt; Second Series (1881), 57-59.

Probabilistic methods are essential to understand the functional role of this variance within the neural activity. In that case, a Poisson process is the most common model of trial-to-trial variability. For a Poisson process, the variance of the spike count is constrained to be equal to the mean, irrespective of the duration of measurements. Numerous studies have shown that this relationship does not generally hold. Specifically, a majority of electrophysiological recordings show an överdispersionëffect: responses that exhibit more intertrial variability than expected from a Poisson process alone. A model that is particularly well suited to quantify overdispersion is the Negative-Binomial distribution model. This model is well-studied and widely used but has only recently been applied to neuroscience. In this article, we address three main issues. First, we describe how the Negative-Binomial distribution provides a model apt to account for overdispersed spike counts. Second, we quantify the significance of this model for any neurophysiological data by proposing a statistical test, which quantifies the odds that overdispersion could be due to the limited number of repetitions (trials). We apply this test to three neurophysiological data sets along the visual pathway. Finally, we compare the performance of this model to the Poisson model on a population decoding task.

The local orientation of their contours and the direction of motion are two essential components of visual information which are processed in parallel in the early visual areas. Focusing on the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey (V1), we challenged different models for the joint representation of orientation and direction within the neural activity. Precisely, we considered the response of V1 neurons to an oriented moving bar to investigate whether, and how, the information about the bar's orientation and direction could be encoded dynamically at the population activity level. For that purpose, we used a decoding approach based on a space-time receptive field model that encodes jointly orientation and direction. We based our decoding approach on the statistics of natural scenes by first determining optimal space-time receptive fields (RFs) that encode orientation and direction. For this, we first derived a set of dynamic filters from a database of natural images~[1] and following an unsupervised learning rule~[2]. More generally, this allows us to propose a dynamic generative model for the joint coding of orientation and direction. Then, using this model and a maximum likelihood paradigm, we infer the most likely representation for a given network activity~[3, 4]. We tested this model on surrogate data and on extracellular recordings in area emphV1 (67 cells) of awake macaque monkeys in response to oriented bars moving in $12$ different directions. Using a cross-validation method we could robustly decode both the orientation and the direction of the bar within the classical receptive field (cRF). Furthermore, this decoding approach shows different properties: First, information about the orientation of the bar is emerging ıt before entering the cRF if the trajectory of the bar is long enough. Second, when testing different orientations with the same direction, our approach unravels that we can decode the direction and the orientation independently. Moreover, we found that, similarly to orientation decoding, the decoding of direction is dynamic but weaker. Finally, our results demonstrate that the orientation and the direction of motion of an ambiguous moving bar can be progressively decoded in V1. This is a signature of a dynamic solution to the aperture problem in area V1, similarly to what was already found in area MT~[5]. $[1]$ J. Burge, W. Geisler.

Specifically, we consider axonal conduction delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filter- ing to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalised coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalised coordinates provides a simple means of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. This compensation is illustrated us- ing neuronal simulations of oculomotor following responses with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the generative model that produces ocular following to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements --- in which the system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted by a (fictive) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can register and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system --- like the oculomotor system --- tries to control its environment with delayed signals.","tags":["active inference"],"title":"Compensation of oculomotor delays in the visual system's network.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Montagnini","Jean-Bernard Damasse","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"ccd74a7dd78c79db61db6426d44a90ad","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/montagnini-16-ecvp/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/montagnini-16-ecvp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["eye movements"],"title":"Effects of motion predictability on anticipatory and visually-guided eye movements: a common prior for sensory processing and motor control?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean-Bernard Damasse","Anna Montagnini","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"bba457f04c75675e91f3d893a33785fc","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/damasse-16-ecvp/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/damasse-16-ecvp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["eye movements","Smooth pursuit eye movement"],"title":"Modeling the effect of dynamic contingencies on anticipatory eye movements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jens Kremkow","Laurent U Perrinet","Cyril Monier","Jose-Manuel Alonso","Ad M Aertsen","Yves Frégnac","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293890,"objectID":"dbce997abfca067b735b3a9e77df0091","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/kremkow-16/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kremkow-16/","section":"publication","summary":"Neurons in the primary visual cortex are known for responding vigorously but with high variability to classical stimuli such as drifting bars or gratings. By contrast, natural scenes are encoded more efficiently by sparse and temporal precise spiking responses. We used a conductance-based model of the visual system in higher mammals to investigate how two specific features of the thalamo-cortical pathway, namely push-pull receptive field organization and synaptic depression, can contribute to this contextual reshaping of V1 responses. By comparing cortical dynamics evoked respectively by natural vs. artificial stimuli in a comprehensive parametric space analysis, we demonstrate that the reliability and sparseness of the spiking responses during natural vision is not a mere consequence of the increased bandwidth in the sensory input spectrum. Rather, it results from the combined impacts of synaptic depression and push-pull inhibition, the later acting for natural scenes as a form of ``effective'' feed-forward inhibition as demonstrated in other sensory systems. Thus, the combination of feedforward-like inhibition with fast thalamo-cortical synaptic depression by simple cells receiving a direct structured input from thalamus composes a generic computational mechanism for generating a sparse and reliable encoding of natural sensory events.","tags":["area-v1","staistics of natural images"],"title":"Push-Pull Receptive Field Organization and Synaptic Depression: Mechanisms for Reliably Encoding Naturalistic Stimuli in V1","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kiana Mansour-Pour","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson","Anna Montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"122ce2e7c14ef823da56ee097c7a9236","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/mansour-16-ecvp/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mansour-16-ecvp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["eye movements","motion detection","motion-clouds"],"title":"Voluntary tracking the moving clouds : Effects of speed variability on human smooth pursuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kiana Mansour-Pour","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson","Anna Montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"2d06995d916b105e915cc3a717ceed3f","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/mansour-16-gdr/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mansour-16-gdr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["eye movements","motion detection","motion-clouds"],"title":"Voluntary tracking the moving clouds : Effects of speed variability on human smooth pursuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kiana Mansour-Pour","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson","Anna Montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"91036ffd42e7f31a24efd73660a365c6","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/mansour-16-sfn/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mansour-16-sfn/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["eye movements","motion detection","motion-clouds"],"title":"Voluntary tracking the moving clouds : Effects of speed variability on human smooth pursuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Cristóbal","Laurent U Perrinet","Matthias S.

That is, as neural activity is recorded in a visual area ---for instance the primary visual cortex of primates--- only a few neurons are active at a given time with respect to the whole population. It is believed that such a property reflects the efficient match of the representation with the statistics of natural scenes. Applying such a paradigm to computer vision therefore seems a promising approach towards more biomimetic algorithms. Herein, we will describe a biologically-inspired approach to this problem. First, we will describe an unsupervised learning paradigm which is particularly adapted to the efficient coding of image patches. Then, we will outline a complete multi-scale framework ---SparseLets--- implementing a biologically inspired sparse representation of natural images. Finally, we will propose novel methods for integrating prior information into these algorithms and provide some preliminary experimental results. We will conclude by giving some perspective on applying such algorithms to computer vision. More specifically, we will propose that bio-inspired approaches may be applied to computer vision using predictive coding schemes, sparse models being one simple and efficient instance of such schemes.","tags":["Biologically Inspired Computer vision","sparse coding"],"title":"Sparse Models for Computer Vision","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Montagnini","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1447714800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560787216,"objectID":"61cb6f383891ef5679c5cfe487534495","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/montagnini-15-bicv/","publishdate":"2015-11-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/montagnini-15-bicv/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Biologically Inspired Computer vision"],"title":"Visual motion processing and human tracking behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1446724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"396d7acc9b8c526046f7762b3b64e0f2","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2015-11-05-chile/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2015-11-05-chile/","section":"talk","summary":" We stand at a point in history where our phones have become smart but lack a feature which prevails in most forms of living intelligence: vision.

These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus enabling visual analysis with high acuity. Importantly, when predictive information is available about the target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM (baseline condition). This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements. To further understand the nature of this process, we investigate the effects of reinforcement on aSPEM with two distinct experiments. First, it has been previously shown that several properties of eye movements can be modulated by reinforcement paradigms based on monetary reward (Madelain et al. 2011). We adapted and extended this framework to prediction-based aSPEM, by associating a monetary reward to a criterion-matching anticipatory velocity, in the gap before the target onset. Second, it has also been reported that accurate perception per se can play the role of an efficient ecological reinforcer for visually guided saccades (Montagnini \u0026 Chelazzi, 2005). With a gaze-contingent procedure, we manipulated the discriminability of a perceptual target (appearing during the pursuit trial and followed by a discrimination task) The difficulty level of this task has been matched depending on the velocity of aSPEM. This experiment taps on the very reason to produce anticipatory tracking movement, that is to grant a quicker high-acuity vision of the moving target. We compare predictive anticipatory eye movements across these conditions.","tags":["eye movements","Smooth pursuit eye movement"],"title":"Anticipatory smooth eye movements and reinforcement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean-Bernard Damasse","Laurent Madelain","Laurent U Perrinet","Anna Montagnini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557397598,"objectID":"898c5896316050e1132aa76ecb74d7e4","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/damasse-15-gdr/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/damasse-15-gdr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["eye movements","Smooth pursuit eye movement"],"title":"Anticipatory smooth eye movements as operant behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Vacher","Andrew Isaac Meso","Laurent U Perrinet","Gabriel Peyré"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"5271085a92f2cbb7f8091cd3cfe0ded3","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/vacher-15-nips/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/vacher-15-nips/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["motion-clouds"],"title":"Biologically Inspired Dynamic Textures for Probing Motion Perception","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","James A.

Scientists examined why volunteers who were shown hundreds of pictures - some with animals and some without - were able to detect animals in as little as one-tenth of a second. They found that one of the first parts of the brain to process visual information - the primary visual cortex - can control this fast response. More complex parts of the brain are not required at this stage, contrary to what was previously thought.

We controlled the quality of the reconstruction from the edge information such that the residual energy was less than 5%.

We show here the histogram for non-animal natural images, illustrating the preference for co-linear edge configurations. For each chevron configuration, deeper and deeper red circles indicate configurations that are more and more likely with respect to a uniform prior, with an average maximum of about $3$ times more likely, and deeper and deeper blue circles indicate configurations less likely than a flat prior (with a minimum of about $0.8$ times as likely). Conveniently, this chevron map shows in one graph that non-animal natural images have on average a preference for co-linear and parallel edges, (the horizontal middle axis) and orthogonal angles (the top and bottom rows),along with a slight preference for co-circular configurations (for $\\psi=0$ and $\\psi=\\pm \\frac \\pi 2$, just above and below the central row). We compare chevron maps in different image categories in Figure~3.

Here, we show the ratio of histogram counts relative to that of the non-animal natural image dataset. Deeper and deeper red circles indicate configurations that are more and more likely (and blue respectively less likely) with respect to the histogram computed for non-animal images. In the left plot, the animal images exhibit relatively more circular continuations and converging angles (red chevrons in the central vertical axis) relative to non-animal natural images, at the expense of co-linear, parallel, and orthogonal configurations (blue circles along the middle horizontal axis). The man-made images have strikingly more co-linear features (central circle), which reflects the prevalence of long, straight lines in the cage images in that dataset. We use this representation to categorize images from these different categories in Figure~4.    Classification results. To quantify the difference in low-level feature statistics across categories (see Figure~3, we used a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to measure how each representation affected the classifier\u0026rsquo;s reliability for identifying the image category. For each individual image, we constructed a vector of features as either (FO) the histogram of first-order statistics as the histogram of edges\u0026rsquo; orientations, (CM) the chevron map subset of the second-order statistics, (i.e., the two-dimensional histogram of relative orientation and azimuth; see Figure 2 ), or (SO) the full, four-dimensional histogram of second-order statistics (i.e., all parameters of the edge co-occurrences). We gathered these vectors for each different class of images and report here the results of the SVM classifier using an F1 score (50\\% represents chance level). While it was expected that differences would be clear between non-animal natural images versus laboratory (man-made) images, results are still quite high for classifying animal images versus non-animal natural images, and are in the range reported by~\\citet{Serre07} (F1 score of 80\\% for human observers and 82\\% for their model), even using the CM features alone. We further extend this results to the psychophysical results of Serre et al. (2007) in Figure 5.    To see whether the patterns of errors made by humans are consistent with our model, we studied the second-order statistics of the 50 non-animal images that human subjects in Serre et al. (2007) most commonly falsely reported as having an animal. We call this set of images the false-alarm image dataset. (Left) This chevron map plot shows the ratio between the second-order statistics of the false-alarm images and the full non-animal natural image dataset, computed as in Figure 3 (left). Just as for the images that actually do contain animals (Figure~3, left), the images falsely reported as having animals have more co-circular and converging (red chevrons) and fewer collinear and orthogonal configurations (blue chevrons). (Right) To quantify this similarity, we computed the Kullback-Leibler distance between the histogram of each of these images from the false-alarm image dataset, and the average histogram of each class. The difference between these two distances gives a quantitative measure of how close each image is to the average histograms for each class. Consistent with the idea that humans are using edge co-occurences to do rapid image categorization, the 50 non-animal images that were worst classified are biased toward the animal histogram ($d\u0026rsquo; = 1.04$), while the 550 best classified non-animal images are closer to the non-animal histogram.  \n  ","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552291724,"objectID":"6c5d7302877e74ebd56153473901a0df","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-bednar-15/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-bednar-15/","section":"publication","summary":"Making a judgment about the semantic category of a visual scene, such as whether it contains an animal, is typically assumed to involve high-level associative brain areas. Previous explanations require progressively analyzing the scene hierarchically at increasing levels of abstraction, from edge extraction to mid-level object recognition and then object categorization. Here we show that the statistics of edge co-occurrences alone are sufficient to perform a rough yet robust (translation, scale, and rotation invariant) scene categorization. We first extracted the edges from images using a scale-space analysis coupled with a sparse coding algorithm. We then computed the ``association field'' for different categories (natural, man-made, or containing an animal) by computing the statistics of edge co-occurrences. These differed strongly, with animal images having more curved configurations. We show that this geometry alone is sufficient for categorization, and that the pattern of errors made by humans is consistent with this procedure. Because these statistics could be measured as early as the primary visual cortex, the results challenge widely held assumptions about the flow of computations in the visual system. The results also suggest new algorithms for image classification and signal processing that exploit correlations between low-level structure and the underlying semantic category.","tags":["association field","Biologically Inspired Computer vision","sparse coding"],"title":"Edge co-occurrences can account for rapid categorization of natural versus animal images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fréderic Danion","Caroline Landelle","Anna Montagnini","Laurent U Perrinet","Laurent Madelain"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"fbfe473d9830ee0090419be17949c1ad","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/danion-15-sfn/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/danion-15-sfn/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Bayesian model"],"title":"Eye tracking a self-moved target with complex hand-target dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wahiba Taouali","Giacomo Benvenuti","Pascal Wallisch","Frédéric Chavane","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293228,"objectID":"2da4f922f8f79c6abb06801a3cd00d33","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/taouali-15-icmns/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/taouali-15-icmns/","section":"publication","summary":"The repeated presentation of an identical visual stimulus in the receptive field of a neuron may evoke different spiking patterns at each trial. Probabilistic methods are essential to understand its functional role within the neural activity. In that case, a Poisson process is the most common model of trial-to-trial variability. However, the variance of the spike count is constrained to be equal to the mean, irrespective of measurement's duration. Numerous studies have shown that this relationship does not generally hold. Specifically, a majority of electrophysiological recordings show an ``em overdispersion'' effect: Responses that exhibit more inter-trial variability than expected from a Poisson process alone. A model that is particularly well suited to quantify overdispersion is the Negative-Binomial distribution model. This model is largely applied and studied but has only recently been applied to neuroscience. In this paper, we address three main issues. First, we describe how the Negative-Binomial distribution provides a model apt to account for overdispersed spike counts. Second, we quantify the significance of this model for any neurophysiological data by proposing a statistical test, which quantifies the odds that overdispersion could be due to the limited number of repetitions (trials). We apply this test to three neurophysiological tests along the visual pathway. Finally, we compare the performance of this model to the Poisson model on a population decoding task. This shows that more knowledge about the form of dispersion tuning is necessary to have a significant gain, uncovering a possible feature of the neural spiking code.","tags":["coding decoding"],"title":"On overdispersion in neuronal evoked activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cesar U Ravello","F.

If we focus on area MT of humans for instance as it is crucial for detecting the motion of visual objects, sensory information coming to this area is already lagging some 35 milliseconds behind operational time – that is, it reflects some past information. Still the fastest action that may be done there is only able to reach the effector muscles of the eyes some 40 milliseconds later – that is, in the future. The tracking eye movement system is however able to respond swiftly and even to anticipate repetitive movements (e.g. Barnes et al, 2000 – refs in manuscript). In that case, it means that information in a cortical area is both predicted from the past sensory information but also anticipated to give an optimal response in the future. Even if numerous models have been described to model different mechanisms to account for delays, no theoretical approach has tackled the whole problem explicitly. In several areas of vision research, authors have proposed models at different levels of abstractions from biomechanical models, to neurobiological implementations (e.g. Robinson, 1986) or Bayesian models. This study is both novel and important because – using a neurobiologically plausible hierarchical Bayesian model – it demonstrates that using generalized coordinates to finesse the prediction of a target\u0026rsquo;s motion, the model can reproduce characteristic properties of tracking eye movements in the presence of delays. Crucially, the different refinements to the model that we propose – pursuit initiation, smooth pursuit eye movements, and anticipatory response – are consistent with the different types of tracking eye movements that may be observed experimentally.  (A) This figure reports the response of predictive processing during the simulation of pursuit initiation, using a single sweep of a visual target, while compensating for sensory motor delays. Here, we see horizontal excursions of oculomotor angle (red line). One can see clearly the initial displacement of the target that is suppressed by action after a few hundred milliseconds. Additionally, we illustrate the effects of assuming wrong sensorimotor delays on pursuit initiation. Under pure sensory delays (blue dotted line), one can see clearly the delay in sensory predictions, in relation to the true inputs. With pure motor delays (blue dashed line) and with combined sensorimotor delays (blue line) there is a failure of optimal control with oscillatory fluctuations in oculomotor trajectories, which may become unstable. (B) This figure reports the simulation of smooth pursuit when the target motion is hemi-sinusoidal, as would happen for a pendulum that would be stopped at each half cycle left of the vertical (broken black lines in the lower-right panel). We report the horizontal excursions of oculomotor angle. The generative model used here has been equipped with a second hierarchical level that contains hidden states, modeling latent periodic behavior of the (hidden) causes of target motion. With this addition, the improvement in pursuit accuracy apparent at the onset of the second cycle of motion is observed (pink shaded area), similar to psychophysical experimentss.  \n","date":1418684400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293890,"objectID":"da20b43c63c3d8b3822f4c1abb68c266","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-adams-friston-14/","publishdate":"2014-12-16T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-adams-friston-14/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper considers the problem of sensorimotor delays in the optimal control of (smooth) eye movements under uncertainty. Specifically, we consider delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalised coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalised coordinates provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the generative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements---in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system---like the oculomotor system---tries to control its environment with delayed signals.","tags":["active inference","Bayesian model","Biologically Inspired Computer vision","eye movements","free energy","motion detection"],"title":"Active inference, eye movements and oculomotor delays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Isaac Meso","Claudio Simoncini","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1408658400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293228,"objectID":"ae53f3d7541e45df40358b9436f2a144","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/meso-14-vss/","publishdate":"2014-08-22T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/meso-14-vss/","section":"publication","summary":"Estimating object speed in visual scenes is a critical part of perception. While various aspects of speed computation including discrimination thresholds, neural mechanisms and spatial integration mechanisms have been studied, there remain areas to elucidate. One is the integration of information across spatio-temporal frequency channels to compute speed. We probe this integration with a 2-AFC psychophysical task in which moving random phase noise stimuli are used with experimenter defined frequency parameters and bandwidths to target specific neural populations. They are presented for 300ms in a large square aperture with smooth eye movements recorded while speed discrimination judgements are made over two intervals. There is no instruction to observers to pursue the stimuli and no pre trial saccade to induce a classic ocular following response. After a latency, eye movements follow the stimulated direction presumably to facilitate the speed judgement. Within each of the two intervals, we randomly vary a range of spatial frequency and speed parameters respectively such that stimuli at the centre of the ranges are identical. The aim is to characterise the speed response of the eye movements recorded in a context which creates an ocular motor 'action' during a perceptual task instead of artificially separating the two. Within the speed varied intervals, averaged eye movements are systematically modulated in strength by stimulus speed. Within the spatial frequency intervals, higher frequencies perceived as faster in discrimination responses interestingly show no corresponding strengthening of eye responses particularly at higher contrasts where they may be weaker. Thus for a pair of stimuli matched for contrast and perceived speed, this early eye response appears to be driven by a contrast dependent low level motion energy like computation. We characterise an underlying spatial frequency response which is shifted towards lower frequencies, unlike the perceptual responses and is probably separate from perception.","tags":["motion-clouds"],"title":"Beyond simply faster and slower: exploring paradoxes in speed perception","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","James A.

Previous proposals have been based on a series of processing steps organized in a multi-level hierarchy that would progressively analyze the scene at increasing levels of abstraction, from contour extraction to low-level object recognition and finally to object categorization (Serre, PNAS 2007). We explore here an alternative hypothesis that the statistics of edge co-occurences are sufficient to perform a rough yet robust (translation, scale, and rotation invariant) scene categorization. The method is based on a realistic model of image analysis in the primary visual cortex that extends previous work from Geisler et al. (Vis. Res. 2001). Using a scale-space analysis coupled with a sparse coding algorithm, we achieved detailed and robust extraction of edges in different sets of natural images. This edge-based representation allows for a simple characterization of the ``association field'' of edges by computing the statistics of co-occurrences. We show that the geometry of angles made between edges is sufficient to distinguish between different sets of natural images taken in a variety of environments (natural, man-made, or containing an animal). Specifically, a simple classifier, working solely on the basis of this geometry, gives performance similar to that of hierarchical models and of humans in rapid-categorization tasks. Such results call attention to the importance of the relative geometry of local image patches in visual computation, with implications for designing efficient image analysis systems. Most importantly, they challenge assumptions about the flow of computations in the visual system and emphasize the relative importance in this process of associative connections, and in particular of intra-areal lateral connections.","tags":["association field","Biologically Inspired Computer vision","sparse coding"],"title":"Edge co-occurrences are sufficient to categorize natural versus animal images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mina A Khoei","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":" Based on Perrinet et al, 2012 and Khoei et al, 2013 See a followup in Khoei et al, 2017  ","date":1408658400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558954465,"objectID":"8bfc879d951c9f5f391701db53807991","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/khoei-14-vss/","publishdate":"2014-08-22T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/khoei-14-vss/","section":"publication","summary":"The flash lag effect (FLE) is a well known visual illusion that reveals the perceptual difference in position coding of moving and stationary flashed objects. It has been reproduced experimentally in retina and V1 along with some relevant evidences about motion based position coding in areas MT and MT+. Numerous hypotheses for mechanisms underlying FLE such as motion extrapolation, latency difference, position persistence, temporal averaging and postdiction have been under debate for last two decades. Here, we have challenged our previous motion-based prediction model to understand FLE, consistently with the motion extrapolation account proposed by Nijhawan. Our hypothesis is based on predictability of motion trajectory and importance of motion signal in manipulation of receptive field shape for moving objects. Using a probabilistic framework, we have implemented motion-based prediction (MBP) and simulated three different demonstrations of FLE including standard, flash initiated and flash terminated cycles. This method allowed us to compare the shape of the characteristic receptive fields for moving and stationary flashed dots in the case of rightward and leftward motions. As control model, we have eliminated velocity signal from motion estimation and simulated position-based (PX) model of FLE. Results of MBP model suggest that above a minimal time for duration of flash, the development of predictive component for the moving object is sufficient to shift in the direction of motion and to produce flash lag effect. MBP model reproduces experimental data of FLE and its dependence to the contrast of flash. Against what has been argued as shortage of motion extrapolation account, in our results spatial lead of moving object is also evident in flash initiated cycle. Our model, without being restricted to one special visual area, provides a generic account for FLE by emphasize on different manipulation of stationary objects and trajectory motion by the sensory system.","tags":["motion detection","motion prediction"],"title":"Motion-based prediction model for flash lag effect","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claudio Simoncini","Anna Montagnini","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1408658400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293228,"objectID":"8437d9dae0e9884eb37137c1c8d7de85","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/simoncini-14-vss/","publishdate":"2014-08-22T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/simoncini-14-vss/","section":"publication","summary":"Under natural viewing conditions, large eye movements are interspace by small eye movements (microsaccade). Recent works have shown that these two kinds of eye movements are generate by the same oculomotor mechanisms (Goffart et al., 2012) and are driven from the same visual information (Simoncini et al., VSS 2012 abstract). These results seem to demonstrate that microsaccade and saccade represent a continuum of the same ocular movement. However, if the role played in vision perception by large saccades is clearly identified, the role of the microsaccade is not clearly defined. In order to investigate the role of microsaccade, we measured pattern discrimination performance using an ABX match-to-sample task during the presentation of 1/f natural statistics texture where we varied the spatial frequency contents. We compared perceptual performance with eye movements recorded during the task. We found that the rate of microsaccadic movements changed as a function of the subjects task strategy. In particular, in the trials where the perception of the difference between the stimuli was simple (low spatial frequency) the subjects used the information provided by all the stimuli to do the task and the microsaccadic rate for all the stimuli (ABX) was the same. However, when the perception of the difference between the stimuli was harder (for instance for high spatial frequency), the subjects rather used the information provided by the last two stimuli only and the microsaccadic rate for the image BX increased respect at the image A. These results demonstrate that microsaccadic eye movements also play a role during the analysis of the visual scene and that such experiments can help decipher their participation to perception of the scene.

Despite these frequents blanks (that is the transient absence of a raw sensory source), the visual system is most often able to maintain a continuous representation of motion. For instance, it maintains the movement of the eye such as to stabilize the image of an object. This ability suggests the existence of a generic neural mechanism of motion extrapolation to deal with fragmented inputs. In this paper, we have modeled how the visual system may extrapolate the trajectory of an object during a blank using motion-based prediction. This implies that using a prior on the coherency of motion, the system may integrate previous motion information even in the absence of a stimulus. In order to compare with experimental results, we simulated tracking velocity responses. We found that the response of the motion integration process to a blanked trajectory pauses at the onset of the blank, but that it quickly recovers the information on the trajectory after reappearance. This is compatible with behavioral and neural observations on motion extrapolation. To understand these mechanisms, we have recorded the response of the model to a noisy stimulus. Crucially, we found that motion-based prediction acted at the global level as a gain control mechanism and that we could switch from a smooth regime to a binary tracking behavior where the dot is tracked or lost. Our results imply that a local prior implementing motion-based prediction is sufficient to explain a large range of neural and behavioral results at a more global level. We show that the tracking behavior deteriorates for sensory noise levels higher than a certain value, where motion coherency and predictability fail to hold longer. In particular, we found that motion-based prediction leads to the emergence of a tracking behavior only when enough information from the trajectory has been accumulated. Then, during tracking, trajectory estimation is robust to blanks even in the presence of relatively high levels of noise. Moreover, we found that tracking is necessary for motion extrapolation, this calls for further experimental work exploring the role of noise in motion extrapolation.","tags":["motion detection","motion prediction"],"title":"Motion-based prediction explains the role of tracking in motion extrapolation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard A Kaplan","Anders Lansner","Guillaume S Masson","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":" Based on Perrinet et al, 2012 See a followup in Khoei et al, 2013  ","date":1379368800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558954465,"objectID":"69cb1f17a99fb25bc6a452138ff47478","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/kaplan-13/","publishdate":"2013-09-17T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kaplan-13/","section":"publication","summary":"Predictive coding hypothesizes that the brain explicitly infers upcoming sensory input to establish a coherent representation of the world.

Object speed and direction are estimated following the integration of information across cortical motion sensitive channels. Speed estimation along this system is not fully understood, particularly the mapping function between the actual speed of viewed objects and that perceived by observers, a question we address in this work. It has been demonstrated that perceived speed is profoundly influenced by object contrast, spatial frequency, stimulus complexity and frequency bandwidth. In a 2 interval forced choice speed discrimination task, we present a random phase textured motion stimulus to probe small shifts in perceived speed measured using fi xed stimulus sets as reference scales while mean spatial frequency and bandwidths serve as the dependent variable in a probe. The presentations are short (200ms). Using a scale of narrowband stimuli (0.2 octaves), we measured a shift in perceived speed; higher frequencies are seen as faster moving than lower ones. On the scale of broader bandwidth (1 octave), this difference across frequency was reduced and perceived speed seems to converge on a slower representation. From these results we estimated this mapping between perceived and veridical stimulus speeds. In direct comparisons, the relative speed is faster for high frequencies and increases in bandwidth make stimuli appear slower. During this early computation, when presented with a random phase stimulus it appears that the visual systems makes assumptions about expected speeds based on the richness of the frequency content and the veridical speed is not explicitly computed. In this first 200ms, the perceptual system perhaps underestimates some speeds in an optimal response for initially stabilizing the scene.

Integration occurs both for stationary objects and moving objects, with very similar time constants (Burr, 1981). We measured, as a function of exposure duration, speed discrimination and ocular following performance for rich textured motion stimuli of varying spatial frequency bandwidth. Psychometric sensitivity and Oculometric sensitivity for these patterns increased with exposure duration. However the best stimuli for ocular following (namely those with a large bandwidth for spatial frequency) was well integrated up to about 150 - 200 msec, while the best stimuli for speed discrimination (small bandwidth) was well integrated up to about 300 msec. Interestingly, discriminability of ocular tracking eye movements follow a non-monotonic time course, due to the contribution of motor noise. These results suggest that although perception and action relies work in synergy, they may be described by two different integrating mechanisms: A low level, fast one guiding the ocular movement to enable one to catch stimuli in the visual fi eld quickly; and a slower one being able to measure the speed difference between two objects translating in the visual fi eld.

This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle -- the minimisation of variational free energy -- to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements -- prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.","tags":["active inference","Bayesian model","eye movements","motion detection"],"title":"Smooth Pursuit and Visual Occlusion: Active Inference and Oculomotor Control in Schizophrenia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","David Fitzpatrick","James A.

Here, we develop the hypothesis that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion.

We observe in simulations a progressive solution to the aperture problem similar to psychophysics and behavior. We demonstrate that this solution is the result of  two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features independently of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are explained away while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global scale.

We ask to what extent such geometric traits influence the '' idle'' dynamics of two-dimensional (2d) cortical network models composed of conductance-based integrate-and-fire (iaf) neurons. In contrast to the typical 1 mm2 used in most studies, we employ an enlarged spatial set-up of 25 mm2 to provide for long-range connections. Our models range from purely random to distance-dependent connectivities including patchy projections, i.e., spatially clustered synapses. Analyzing the characteristic measures for synchronicity and regularity in neuronal spiking, we explore and compare the phase spaces and activity patterns of our simulation results. Depending on the input parameters, different dynamical states appear, similar to the known synchronous regular '' SR'' or asynchronous irregular '' AI'' firing in random networks. Our structured networks, however, exhibit shifted and sharper transitions, as well as more complex activity patterns. Distance-dependent connectivity structures induce a spatio-temporal spread of activity, e.g., propagating waves, that random networks cannot account for. Spatially and temporally restricted activity injections reveal that a high amount of local coupling induces rather unstable AI dynamics. We find that the amount of local versus long-range connections is an important parameter, whereas the structurally advantageous wiring cost optimization of patchy networks has little bearing on the phase space.","tags":["lateral connections"],"title":"Complex dynamics in recurrent cortical networks based on spatially realistic connectivities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claudio Simoncini","Anna Montagnini","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325372400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293228,"objectID":"efe92d24d9f32dc735f83ebfb549a481","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/simoncini-12-vss/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/simoncini-12-vss/","section":"publication","summary":"Under natural viewing conditions, small movements of the eyes prevent the maintenance of a steady direction of gaze. It is unclear how the spatiotemporal content of the fixated scene has an impact on the properties of miniatures, fixational eye movements. We have investigated the characteristics of fixational eye movements recorded while human subjects are instructed to fixate natural statistics random textures (Motion Clouds) in which we manipulated the spatial frequency content. We used long presentations (5 sec) of Motion Clouds stimuli (Schrater et al. 2000) of varying spatial frequency bandwidths (Bsf) around different central spatial frequency (Sf0). We found that central spatial frequency has an effect upon microsaccadic eye movements. In particular, smaller saccadic amplitudes were associated with high spatial frequencies, and larger saccades with low spatial frequencies. Broadening the spatial frequency bandwidth also changed the distribution of microsaccade amplitudes.

One yet unsolved question is to understand how the brain pools this information and whether this pooling is generic or adaptive at the behavioral contexts. Here, we investigate in humans this integration process for two different tasks: psychophysical speed discrimination and ocular following eye movements, which are a probe of early motion detection and integration (Masson \u0026 Perrinet, 2011). For both tasks, we used short presentations of ``moving textures'' stimuli (Schrater et al., 2000) in which the width of the spatial frequency distribution (Bsf) was varied. We found that larger Bsf elicited stronger initial eye velocity during the open-loop part of tracking responses. Moreover, richer stimuli resulted in more accurate and reliable motor responses. By contrast, larger Bsf had a detrimental effect upon speed discrimination performance: speed discrimination thresholds linearly decreased when the width of spatial frequency distribution increased. These opposite results can be explained by a different decoding strategy where speed information is under the control of different gain setting mechanisms. We tested this model by measuring contrast response functions of both ocular following and speed discrimination for each Bsf. We found that varying spatial frequency distribution had opposite effect upon contrast gain control. Increasing Bsf lowered half-saturation contrast for ocular following but increased it for perception. Our results supports the view that speed-based perception and tracking eye movements are under the control of different early decoding mechanism. References Masson, G.S. \u0026 Perrinet, L.U.

We represent as arrows the velocity vectors that are most likely detected by a motion energy model; hue indicates direction angle. Introducing predictive coding resolves the aperture problem.    Figure 1: (A) The estimation of the motion of an elongated, slanted segment (here moving horizontally to the right) on a limited area (such as the dotted circle) leads to ambiguous velocity measurements compared to physical motion: it’s the aperture problem. We represent as arrows the velocity vectors that are most likely detected by a motion energy model; hue indicates direction angle. Due to the limited size of receptive fields in sensory cortical areas (such as shown by the dotted white circle), such problem is faced by local populations of neurons that visually estimate the motion of objects. (A-inset) On a polar representation of possible velocity vectors (the cross in the center corresponds to the null velocity, the outer circle corresponding to twice the amplitude of physical speed), we plot the empirical histogram of detected velocity vectors. This representation gives a quantification of the aperture problem in the velocity domain: At the onset of motion detection, information is concentrated along an elongated constraint line (white=high probability, black=zero probability). (B) We use the prior knowledge that in natural scenes, motion as defined by its position and velocity is following smooth trajectories. Quantitatively, it means that velocity is approximately conserved and that position is transported according to the known velocity. We show here such a transition on position and velocity (respectively $x_t$ and $V_t$) from time t to t + dt with the perturbation modeling the smoothness of prediction in position and velocity (respectively $N_x$ and $N_V$). \u0026copy; Applying such a prior on a dynamical system detecting motion, we show that motion converges to the physical motion after approximately one spatial period (the line moved by twice its height). (C-Inset) The read-out of the system converged to the physical motion: Motion-based prediction is sufficient to resolve the aperture problem. (D) As observed at the perceptual level [Castet et al., 1993, Pei et al., 2010], size and duration of the tracking angle bias decreased with respect to the height of the line. Height was measured relative to a spatial period (respectively 60%, 40% and 20%). Here we show the average tracking angle red-out from the probabilistic representation as a function of time, averaged over 20 trials (error bars show one standard deviation).    Figure 2: Architecture of the model. The model is constituted by a classical measurement stage and of a predictive coding layer. The measurement stage consists of (A) inferring from two consecutive frames of the input flow, (B) a likelihood distribution of motion. This layer interacts with the predictive layer which consists of \u0026copy; a prediction stage that infers from the current estimate and the transition prior the upcoming state estimate and (D) an estimation stage that merges the current prediction of motion with the likelihood measured at the same instant in the previous layer (B).    Figure 3: To explore the state-space of the dynamical system, we simulated motion-based prediction for a simple small dot (size 2.5% of a spatial period) moving horizontally from the left to the right of the screen. We tested different levels of sensory noise with respect to different levels of internal noise, that is, to different values of the strength of prediction. (Right) Results show the emergence of different states for different prediction precisions: a regime when prediction is weak and which shows high tracking error and variability (No Tracking - NT), a phase for intermediate values of prediction strength (as in Figure 1) exhibiting a low tracking error and low variability in the tracking phase (True Tracking - TT) and finally a phase corresponding to higher precisions with relatively efficient mean detection but high variability (False Tracking - FT). We give 3 representative examples of the emerging states at one contrast level (C = 0.1) with starting (red) and ending (blue) points and respectively NT, TT and FT by showing inferred trajectories for each trial. (Left) We define tracking error as the ratio between detected speed and target speed and we plot it with respect to the stimulus contrast as given by the inverse of sensory noise. Error bars give the variability in tracking error as averaged over 20 trials. As prediction strength increases, there is a transition from smooth contrast response function (NT) to more binary responses (TT and FT).    Figure 4: (Top) Prediction implements a competition between different trajectories. Here, we focus on one step of the algorithm by testing different trajectories at three key positions of the segment stimulus: the two edges and the center (dashed circles). Compared to the pure sensory velocity likelihood (left insets in grayscale), prediction modulates response as shown by the velocity vectors (direction coded as hue as in Figure 1) and by the ratio of velocity probabilities (log ratio in bits, right insets). There is no change for the middle of the segment (yellow tone), but trajectories that are predicted out of the line are “explained away” (navy tone) while others may be amplified (orange tone). Notice the asymmetry between both edges, the upper edge carrying a suppressive predictive information while the bottom edge diffuses coherent motion. (Bottom) Finally, the aperture problem is solved due to the repeated application of this spatio-temporal contextual information modulation. To highlight the anisotropic diffusion of information over the rest of the line, we plot as a function of time (horizontal axis) the histogram of the detected motion marginalized over horizontal positions (vertical axis), while detected direction of velocity is given by the distribution of hues. Blueish colors correspond to the direction perpendicular to the diagonal while a green color represents a disambiguated motion to the right (as in Figure 1). The plot shows that motion is disambiguated by progressively explaining away incoherent motion. Note the asymmetry in the propagation of coherent information.  \n","date":1325372400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560787216,"objectID":"b1a5f2187cfabe1c229fc75c6b18bbd0","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-12-pred/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-12-pred/","section":"publication","summary":"In low-level sensory systems, it is still unclear how the noisy information collected locally by neurons may give rise to a coherent global percept.

This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently.

Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that during the initial stages of the motion information processing, 1D motion cues related to the object's edges have a dominating influence over the estimate of the object's global motion. However, during the later stages, 2D motion cues related to terminators (edge-endings) progressively take over, leading to a final correct estimate of the object's global motion. Here, we propose a recursive extension to the Bayesian framework for motion processing (Weiss, Simoncelli, \u0026 Adelson, 2002) cascaded with a model oculomotor plant to describe the dynamic integration of 1D and 2D motion information in the context of smooth pursuit eye movements. In the recurrent Bayesian framework, the prior defined in the velocity space is combined with the two independent measurement likelihood functions, representing edge-related and terminator-related information, respectively to obtain the posterior. The prior is updated with the posterior at the end of each iteration step. The maximum-a posteriori (MAP) of the posterior distribution at every time step is fed into the oculomotor plant to produce eye velocity responses that are compared to the human smooth pursuit data. The recurrent model was tuned with the variance of pursuit responses to either p̈ure1̈D or r̈̈e ̈̈motion. The oculomotor plant was tuned with an independent set of oculomotor data, including the effects of line length (i.e. stimulus energy) and directional anisotropies in the smooth pursuit responses. The model not only provides an accurate qualitative account of dynamic motion integration but also a quantitative account that is close to the smooth pursuit response across several conditions (three contrasts and three speeds) for two human subjects.","tags":["Bayesian model","predictive coding"],"title":"Pursuing motion illusions: a realistic oculomotor framework for Bayesian inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jérôme Fleuriet","S.

Previous studies have shown that these saccades are characterized by a lower peak velocity and a prolonged deceleration phase. In some cases, a second peak eye velocity appears during the deceleration phase, presumably reflecting the late influence of a mechanism that compensates for the target displacement occurring before saccade end. The goal of this work was to further determine in the head restrained monkey the dynamics of this putative compensatory mechanism. A step-ramp paradigm, where the target motion was orthogonal to a target step occurring along the primary axes, was used to estimate from the generated saccades: a component induced by the target step and another one induced by the target motion. Resulting oblique saccades were compared with saccades to a static target with matched horizontal and vertical amplitudes. This study permitted to estimate the time taken for visual motion-related signals to update the programming and execution of saccades. The amplitude of the motion-related component was slightly hypometric with an undershoot that increased with target speed. Moreover, it matched with the eccentricity that the target had 40-60 ms before saccade end. The lack of significant difference in the delay between the onsets of the horizontal and vertical components between saccades directed toward a static target and those aimed at a moving target questions the late influence of the compensatory mechanism.

The visual system appears to take advantage of this prior information, and human contour detection and grouping performance is well predicted by such an ässociation field(̈Field et al., Vis Res 33:173-93, 1993). One possible candidate substrate for implementing an association field in mammals is the set of long-range lateral connections between neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), which could act to facilitate detection of contours matching the association field, and/or inhibit detection of other contours (Choe and Miikkulainen, Biol Cyb 90:75-88, 2004). To fill this role, the lateral connections would need to be orientation specific and aligned along contours, and indeed such an arrangement has been found in tree shrew primary visual cortex (Bosking et al., J Neurosci 17:2112-27, 1997). However, it is not yet known whether these patterns develop as a result of visual experience, or are simply hard-wired to be appropriate for the statistics of natural scenes. To investigate this issue, we examined the properties of the visual environment of laboratory animals, to determine whether the observed connection patterns are more similar to the statistics of the rearing environment or of a natural habitat. Specifically, we analyzed the cooccurence statistics of edge elements in images of natural scenes, and compared them to corresponding statistics for images taken from within the rearing environment of the animals in the Bosking et al. (1997) study. We used a modified version of the algorithm from Geisler et al. (2001), with a more general edge extraction algorithm that uses sparse coding to avoid multiple responses to a single edge. Collinearity and co-circularity results for natural images replicated qualitatively the results from Geisler et al. (2001), confirming that prior information about continuations appeared consistently in natural images. However, we find that the largely man-made environment in which these animals were reared has a significantly higher probability of collinear edge elements. We thus predict that if the lateral connection patterns are due to visual experience, the patterns in wild-raised tree shrews would be very different from those measured by Bosking et al. (1997), with shorter-range correlations and less emphasis on collinear continuations. This prediction can be tested in future experiments on matching groups of animals reared in different environments. W.H. Bosking and Y. Zhang and B. Schofield and D.

One approach to understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism which optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair: By contributing to optimize statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.","tags":["association field","coding decoding","eye movements","homeostasis","matching pursuit","motion-clouds","receptive field","sparse coding","sparse hebbian learning","staistics of natural images","unsupervised learning"],"title":"Role of homeostasis in learning sparse representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jens Kremkow","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson","Ad M Aertsen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1276725600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560787216,"objectID":"2590699cb285c082e8a08c05d6fc292b","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/kremkow-10-jcns/","publishdate":"2010-06-17T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kremkow-10-jcns/","section":"publication","summary":"Neurons in the neocortex receive a large number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Excitation and inhibition dynamically balance each other, with inhibition lagging excitation by only few milliseconds. To characterize the functional consequences of such correlated excitation and inhibition, we studied models in which this correlation structure is induced by feedforward inhibition (FFI). Simple circuits show that an effective FFI changes the integrative behavior of neurons such that only synchronous inputs can elicit spikes, causing the responses to be sparse and precise. Further, effective FFI increases the selectivity for propagation of synchrony through a feedforward network, thereby increasing the stability to background activity. Last, we show that recurrent random networks with effective inhibition are more likely to exhibit dynamical network activity states as have been observed in vivo. Thus, when a feedforward signal path is embedded in such recurrent network, the stabilizing effect of effective inhibition creates an suitable substrate for signal propagation. In conclusion, correlated excitation and inhibition support the notion that synchronous spiking may be important for cortical processing.","tags":["center-surround interactions","coding decoding","pynn","sparse coding"],"title":"Functional consequences of correlated excitatory and inhibitory conductances in cortical networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":" see this more recent talk @ UCL, London  ","date":1262905200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558795419,"objectID":"2a62ff6216b24f758b5b2983b53eb822","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2010-01-08-facets/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2010-01-08-facets/","section":"talk","summary":" see this more recent talk @ UCL, London  ","tags":["Bayesian model","center-surround interactions","dynamics","eye movements","motion detection","motion prediction"],"title":"Models of low-level vision: linking probabilistic models and neural masses","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Amarender Bogadhi","Anna Montagnini","Pascal Mamassian","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262300400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"ee628b17e38527b78a891e55524304f8","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/bogadhi-10-vss/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bogadhi-10-vss/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Bayesian model"],"title":"A recurrent Bayesian model of dynamic motion integration for smooth pursuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emmanuel Daucé","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262300400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551652743,"objectID":"bfd3f7e2cf62354c33d072a05e6eb5bc","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/dauce-10/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dauce-10/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the long and fruitful history of neuroscience, a global, multi-level description of cardinal brain functions is still far from reach.

Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in V1 cortical activity in response to center-surround gratings patterns measured with real-time optical imaging in awake monkeys (see poster of Reynaud et al., VSS09). Based on a previously developed Bayesian framework, we have developed an optimal statistical decoder of such an observed cortical population activity as recorded by optical imaging. This model aims at characterizing the statistical dependance between early neuronal activity and ocular responses and its performance was analyzed by comparing this neuronal read-out and the actual motor responses on a trial-by-trial basis. First, we show that relative performance of the behavioral contrast response function is similar to the best estimate obtained from the neural activity. In particular, we show that the latency of ocular response increases with low contrast conditions as well as with noisier instances of the behavioral task as decoded by the model. Then, we investigate the temporal dynamics of both neuronal and motor responses and show how motion information as represented by the model is integrated in space to improve population decoding over time. Lastly, we explore how a surrounding velocity non congruous with the central excitation information shunts the ocular response and how it is topographically represented in the cortical activity.

However, doing so rapidly and efficiently is constrained by a number of noise sources in the visual system and by the fact that information is collected locally before giving raise to a global signal. After reviewing some results made in the modeling of low-level sensory areas, I will expose a method to decode low-level neural information as describing visual information using a probabilistic representation. Decisions will therefore correspond to statistical inferences which are dynamically resolving the veridical speed of a moving object. We will illustrate this method by showing how ambiguous local information can be merged to give raise to a global response which resolves the aperture problem.

Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in V1 cortical activity in response to center-surround gratings patterns measured with real-time optical imaging in awake monkeys. More recent experiments of OFR have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the global spatial integration of motion from an intermediate map of possible local translation velocities: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving OFR, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barthelemy06,Barthelemy07]. In fact, the machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensorimotor transformation is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory [Weiss02] and we extended in the dynamical domain the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a probabilistic representation. We proved that this model is successfully adapted to model the OFR for the different experiments [Perrinet07neurocomp], that is for different levels of noise with full field gratings, with disks of various sizes and also for the effect of a flickering surround. However, another emphad hoc inhibitory mechanism has to be added in this model to account for suppressive effects of the surround. We explore here an hypothesis where this could be understood as the effect of a recurrent prediction of information in the velocity map. In fact, in previous models, the integration step assumes independence of the local information while natural scenes are very predictable: Due to the rigidity and inertia of physical objects in visual space, neighboring local spatiotemporal information is redundant and one may introduce this empha priori knowledge of the statistics of the input in the ideal observer model. We implement this in a realistic model of a layer representing velocities in a map of cortical columns, where predictions are implemented by lateral interactions within the cortical area. First, raw velocities are estimated locally from images and are propagated to this area in a feed-forward manner. Using this velocity map, we progressively learn the dependance of local velocities in a second layer of the model. This algorithm is cyclic since the prediction is using the local velocities which are themselves using both the feed-forward input and the prediction: We control the convergence of this process by measuring results for different learning rate. Results show that this simple model is sufficient to disambiguate characteristic patterns such as the Barber-Pole illusion. Due to the recursive network which is modulating the velocity map, it also explains that the representation may exhibit some memory, such as when an object suddenly disappears or when presenting a dot followed by a line (line-motion illusion). Finally, we applied this model that was tuned over a set of natural scenes to gratings of increasing sizes. We observed first that the feed-forward response as tuned to neurophysiological data gave lower responses at higher eccentricities, and that this effect was greater for higher grating frequencies. Then, we observed that depending on the size of the disk and on its spatial frequency, the recurrent network of lateral interactions Lastly, we explore how a surrounding velocity non congruous with the central excitation information shunts the ocular response and how it is topographically represented in the cortical activity.","tags":["Bayesian model","center-surround interactions","eye movements","lateral connections","motion detection","visual perception"],"title":"Decoding center-surround interactions in population of neurons for the ocular following response","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicole Voges","Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230764400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551652743,"objectID":"8527e135d8e8743af128baea9dcdd297","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/voges-09-cosyne/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/voges-09-cosyne/","section":"publication","summary":"Most studies of cor tical network dynamics are either based on purely random wiring or neighborhood cou- plings, e.g., [Kumar, Schrader, Aer tsen, Rotter, 2008, Neural Computation 20, 1--43]. Neuronal connections in the cor tex, however, show a complex spatial pattern composed of local and long-range connections, the latter featuring a so-called patchy projection pattern, i.e., spatially clustered synapses [Binzegger, Douglas, Martin, 2007, J. Neurosci. 27(45), 12242--12254]. The idea of our project is to provide and to analyze probabilistic network models that more adequately represent horizontal connectivity in the cor tex. In par- ticular, we investigate the effect of specific projection patterns on the dynamical state space of cor tical networks. Assuming an enlarged spatial scale we employ a distance dependent connectivity that reflects the geometr y of dendrites and axons. We simulate the network dynamics using a neuronal network simula- tor NEST/PyNN. Our models are composed of conductance based integrate-and-fire neurons, representing fast spiking inhibitor y and regular spiking excitator y cells. In order to compare the dynamical state spaces of previous studies with our network models we consider the following connectivity assumptions: purely random or purely local couplings, a combination of local and distant synapses, and connectivity structures with patchy projections. Similar to previous studies, we also find different dynamical states depending on the input parameters: the external input rate and the numerical relation between excitator y and inhibitor y synaptic weights. These states, e.g., synchronous regular (SR) or asynchronous irregular (AI) firing, are characterized by measures like the mean firing rate, the correlation coefficient, the coefficient of variation and so for th. On top of identified biologically realistic background states (AI), stimuli are applied in order to analyze their stability. Comparing the results of our different network models we find that the param- eter space necessar y to describe all possible dynamical states of a network is much more concentrated if local couplings are involved. The transition between different states is shifted (with respect to both in- put parameters) and shar pened in dependence of the relative amount of local couplings. Local couplings strongly enhance the mean firing rate, and lead to smaller values of the correlation coefficient. In terms of emergence of synchronous states, however, networks with local versus non-local or patchy versus random remote connections exhibit a higher probability of synchronized spiking. Concerning stability, preliminar y results indicate that again networks with local or patchy connections show a higher probability of changing from the AI to the SR state. We conclude that the combination of local and remote projections bears impor- tant consequences on the activity of network: The apparent differences we found for distinct connectivity assumptions in the dynamical state spaces suggest that network dynamics strongly depend on the con- nectivity structure. This effect might be even stronger with respect to the spatio-temporal spread of signal propagation.

Neuronal connections in the cortex, however, show a more complex spatial pattern composed of local and long-range patchy connections [2,3] as shown in the figure: It represents a tracer injection (gray areas) in the GM of a flattened cortex (top view): Black dots indicate neuron positions, blue lines their patchy axonal ramifications, and red lines represent the local connections. Moreover, to include distant synapses, one has to enlarge the spatial scale from the typically assumed 1mm to 5mm side length. As it is our aim to analyze more realistic network models of the cortex we assume a distance dependent connectivity that reflects the geometry of dendritesand axons [3]. Here, we ask to what extent the assumption of specific geometric traits influences the resulting dynamical behavior of these networks. Analyzing various characteristic measures that describe spiking neurons (e.g., coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient), we compare the dynamical state spaces of different connectivity types: purely random or purely local couplings, a combination of local and distant synapses, and connectivity structures with patchy projections. On top of biologically realistic background states, a stimulus is applied in order to analyze their stabilities.

On average, excitation (Gexc) and inhibition (Ginh) balance each other, such that spikes are elicited by fluctuations [1]. In addition, it has been shown in vivo that Gexc and Ginh are correlated, with Ginh lagging Gexc only by few milliseconds (6ms), creating a small temporal integration window [2,3]. This correlation structure could be induced by feed-forward inhibition (FFI), which has been shown to be present at many sites in the central nervous system. To characterize the functional consequences of the FFI, we first modeled a simple circuit using spiking neurons with conductance based synapses and studied the effect on the single neuron integration. We then coupled many of such circuits to construct a feed-forward network (synfire chain [4,5]) and investigated the effect of FFI on signal propagation along such feed-forward network. We found that the small temporal integration window, induced by the FFI, changes the integrative properties of the neuron. Only transient stimuli could produce a response when the FFI was active whereas without FFI the neuron responded to both steady and transient stimuli. Due to the increase in selectivity to transient inputs, the conditions of signal propagation through the feed-forward network changed as well. Whereas synchronous inputs could reliable propagate, high asynchronous input rates, which are known to induce synfire activity [6], failed to do so. In summary, the FFI increased the stability of the synfire chain. Supported by DFG SFB 780, EU-15879-FACETS, BMBF 01GQ0420 to BCCN Freiburg [1] Kumar A., Schrader S., Aertsen A. and Rotter S. (2008).

We present in this seminar our attempt in modeling low-level vision by bridging different integration levels, from neural spiking activity to behavior. At the behavioral level, the Ocular Following Response recorded in the laboratory reveals how the brain may integrate local information (moving images on visual receptive fields) to produce a single behavioral response (the movement of the eye). Using a probabilistic representation, we provide a simple integrative mechanism that gives the ''ideal'' response to possibly noisy and ambiguous information, similarly to a Bayesian approach. This fits well the performance revealed by behavioral data and may act as a generic cortical ''module''. At the population level, these mechanisms may indeed be implemented for the coding of natural images and we will show the particular importance of spiking representations and lateral interactions for efficient and rapid responses. In particular, we will present an original unsupervised learning algorithm that we applied to a model of the primary visual cortex. Finally, at the neuronal level, I will present work done in the team showing how certain mechanisms at the level of the synapse and of the neuron are essential at the population level and how we may understand these mechanisms at the population level. This illustrates the importance of dynamical processes, distributed activity and recurrent connections to produce a cortical gain control mechanism. As a conclusion, this approach provides useful applications for image processing and possible valorization in future computer architectures. More generally, it proves that the use of a probabilistic representation is a particularly efficient method for bridging biological versus computational neuroscience and illustrates the advantage of such an interdisciplinary approach.","tags":null,"title":"From neural activity to behavior: computational neuroscience as a synthetic approach for understanding the neural code.","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Frédéric V.

The dynamics of this motion integration shows a complex time course as read from tracking eye movements: first, local 1D motion signals are extracted and pooled to initiate ocular responses, then 2D motion signals are integrated to adjust the tracking direction until it matches the surface motion direction. The nature of these 1D and 2D motion computations are still unclear. One hypothesis is that their different dynamics may be explained from different contrast sensitivities. To test this, we measured contrast-response functions of early, 1D-driven and late, 2D-driven components of ocular following responses to different motion stimuli: gratings, plaids and barberpoles. We found that contrast dynamics of 1D-driven responses are nearly identical across the different stimuli. On the contrary, late 2D-driven components with either plaids or barberpoles have similar latencies but different contrast dynamics. Temporal dynamics of both 1D- and 2D-driven responses demonstrates that the different contrast gains are set very early during the response time course. Running a Bayesian model of motion integration, we show that a large family of contrast-response functions can be predicted from the probability distributions of 1D and 2D motion signals for each stimulus and by the shape of the prior distribution. However, the pure delay (i.e. largely independent upon contrast) observed between 1D- and 2D-motion supports the fact that 1D and 2D probability distributions are computed independently. This two-pathway Bayesian model supports the idea that 1D and 2D mechanisms represent edges and features motion in parallel.","tags":["Bayesian model","eye movements","motion detection","motion-clouds"],"title":"Dynamics of distributed 1D and 2D motion representations for short-latency ocular following.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":" related publications @ FENS 2006, @ NeuroComp 2008 and @ AREADNE 2008  ","date":1201820400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556265459,"objectID":"2fcff0a66fda90fd0fe4cfd8d2dcd05c","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/talk/2008-02-01-toledo/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2008-02-01-toledo/","section":"talk","summary":" related publications @ FENS 2006, @ NeuroComp 2008 and @ AREADNE 2008  ","tags":null,"title":"Modeling of spikes, sparseness and adaptation in the primary visual cortex: applications to imaging","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199142000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552988439,"objectID":"9462f242e261f60e9b9dc531e2ee68a0","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-08-spie/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-08-spie/","section":"publication","summary":"If modern computers are sometimes superior to cognition in some specialized tasks such as playing chess or browsing a large database, they can't beat the efficiency of biological vision for such simple tasks as recognizing a relative or following an object in a complex background. We present in this paper our attempt at outlining the dynamical, parallel and event-based representation for vision in the architecture of the central nervous system. We will illustrate this by showing that in a signal matching framework, a L/LN (linear/non-linear) cascade may efficiently transform a sensory signal into a neural spiking signal and we apply this framework to a model retina. However, this code gets redundant when using an over-complete basis as is necessary for modeling the primary visual cortex: we therefore optimize the efficiency cost by increasing the sparseness of the code. This is implemented by propagating and canceling redundant information using lateral interactions. We compare the efficiency of this representation in terms of compression as the reconstruction quality as a function of the coding length. This will correspond to a modification of the Matching Pursuit algorithm where the ArgMax function is optimized for competition, or Competition Optimized Matching Pursuit (COMP). We will particularly focus on bridging neuroscience and image processing and on the advantages of such an interdisciplinary approach.","tags":["association field","Biologically Inspired Computer vision","coding decoding","inhibition","matching pursuit","sparse coding","sparse hebbian learning","spike"],"title":"Adaptive Sparse Spike Coding : applications of Neuroscience to the compression of natural images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jens Kremkow","Laurent U Perrinet","Pierre Baudot","Manu Levy","Olivier Marre","Cyril Monier","Yves Frégnac","Guillaume S Masson","Ad M Aertsen"],"categories":null,"content":" see this subsequent paper in the Journal of Computational Neuroscience  ","date":1199142000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556266008,"objectID":"6f891adfcd8747291a84855cd02d486e","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/kremkow-08-sfn/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kremkow-08-sfn/","section":"publication","summary":"In the primary visual cortex (V1), single cell responses to simple visual stimuli (gratings) are usually dense but with a high trial-by-trial variability. In contrast, when exposed to full field natural scenes, the firing patterns of these neurons are sparse but highly reproducible over trials (Marre et al., 2005; Frégnac et al., 2006). It is still not understood how these two classes of stimuli can elicit these two distinct firing behaviours. A common model for simple-cell computation in layer 4 is the ``push-pull'' circuitry (Troyer et al. 1998). It accounts for the observed anti-phase behaviour between excitatory and inhibitory conductances in response to a drifting grating (Anderson et al., 2000; Monier et al., 2008), creating a wide temporal integration window during which excitation is integrated without the shunting or opponent effect of inhibition and allowed to elicit multiple spikes. This is in contrast to recent results from intracellular recordings in vivo during presentation of natural scenes (Baudot et al., submitted). Here the excitatory and inhibitory conductances were highly correlated, with inhibition lagging excitation only by few milliseconds (̃6 ms). This small lag creates a narrow temporal integration window such that only synchronized excitatory inputs can elicit a spike, similar to parallel observations in other cortical sensory areas (Wehr and Zador, 2003; Okun and Lampl, 2008). To investigate the cellular and network mechanisms underlying these two different correlation structures, we constructed a realistic model of the V1 network using spiking neurons with conductance based synapses. We calibrated our model to fit the irregular ongoing activity pattern as well as in vivo conductance measurements during drifting grating stimulation and then extracted predicted responses to natural scenes seen through eye-movements. Our simulations reproduced the above described experimental observation, together with anti-phase behaviour between excitation and inhibition during gratings and phase lagged activation during natural scenes. In conclusion, the same cortical network that shows dense and variable responses to gratings exhibits sparse and precise spiking to natural scenes. Work is under way to show to which extent this feature is specific for the feedforward vs recurrent nature of the modelled circuit.","tags":["feed-forward_inhibition","large-scale_networks"],"title":"Control of the temporal interplay between excitation and inhibition by the statistics of visual input: a V1 network modelling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199142000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293228,"objectID":"70ebc9151fa803247875baa3c1aa43c0","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-08-areadne/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-08-areadne/","section":"publication","summary":"The machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensorimotor transformation, such as in Ocular Following Response (OFR), is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system.

On the one hand, each simulator uses its own programming or configuration language, leading to considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes it harder to reproduce and build on the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results can be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater confidence in their correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task. A common programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the problems of simulator diversity while retaining the benefits. PyNN is such an interface, making it possible to write a simulation script once, using the Python programming language, and run it without modification on any supported simulator (currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI neuromorphic hardware). PyNN increases the productivity of neuronal network modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization and data-management tools.

A Bayesian framework ac- counting for the sensory noise and general expectancies for ob ject velocities has proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning early motion processing [1, 2, 3].

These transforms are generally overcomplete and consequently offer huge degrees of freedom in their design. At the same time their optimization get a challenging task. We proposed here a log-Gabor wavelet transform gathering the excellent mathematical properties of the Gabor functions with a carefully construction to maintain the properties of the filters and to permit exact reconstruction. Two major improvements are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. And second, all the frequency bands including the highest and lowest frequencies are uniformly covered so as exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible). The transform is optimized not only mathematically but it also follows as much as possible the knowledge on the receptive field of the simple cells of the Primary Visual Cortex (V1) of primates and on the statistics of natural images. Compared to the state of the art, the log-Gabor wavelets show excellent behavior in their ability to segregate the image information (e.g. the contrast edges) from incoherent Gaussian noise by hard thresholding and to code the image features through a reduced set of coefficients with large magnitude. Such characteristics make the transform a promising tool for general image processing tasks.","tags":["Biologically Inspired Computer vision","log-gabor","visual perception"],"title":"Self-Invertible 2D Log-Gabor Wavelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Montagnini","Pascal Mamassian","Laurent U Perrinet","Eric Castet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167606000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551652743,"objectID":"2e0b6df605f6630767de8592454967cf","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/montagnini-07-a/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/montagnini-07-a/","section":"publication","summary":"When the visual information about an object's motion differs at the local level, the visuomotor system needs to integrate information across time to solve this ambiguity and converge to the final motion solution.

We have previously shown that ocular tracking of this kind of stimuli is transiently biased toward the edge-orthogonal direction, before converging to the global motion direction. Here, we model the dynamic convergence to the global-motion solution as a recursive update of inferential knowledge in the velocity space. We assume that motion estimation is based on a prior distribution and two independent likelihood functions representing edge-related and terminator-related information.

This inverse problem is NP-complete and we propose here a greedy solution which is based on the architecture and nature of neural computations [2]).

Python leverages a vast developer-base external to the neuroscience community, and promises leaps in simulation complexity and maintainability to any neural simulator that adopts it. PyNN http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN strives to provide a uniform application programming interface (API) across neural simulators. Presently NEURON and NEST are supported, and support for other simulators and neuromorphic VLSI hardware is under development. With PyNN it is possible to write a simulation script once and run it without modification on any supported simulator. It is also possible to write a script that uses capabilities specific to a single simulator. While this sacrifices simulator-independence, it adds flexibility, and can be a useful step in porting models between simulators. The design goals of PyNN include allowing access to low-level details of a simulation where necessary, while providing the capability to model at a high level of abstraction, with concomitant gains in development speed and simulation maintainability. Another of our aims with PyNN is to increase the productivity of neuroscience modeling, by making it faster to develop models de novo, by promoting code sharing and reuse across simulator communities, and by making it much easier to debug, test and validate simulations by running them on more than one simulator. Modelers would then become free to devote more software development effort to innovation, building on the simulator core with new tools such as network topology databases, stimulus programming, analysis and visualization tools, and simulation accounting. The resulting, community-developed 'meta-simulator' system would then represent a powerful tool for overcoming the so-called complexity bottleneck that is presently a major roadblock for neural modeling.","tags":["pynn"],"title":"PyNN: towards a universal neural simulator API in Python","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvain Fischer","Rafael Redondo","Laurent U Perrinet","Gabriel Cristóbal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167606000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"417b4362d9153ab18454a4ab8dd41a0c","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/fischer-07/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fischer-07/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["association field","Biologically Inspired Computer vision","log-gabor","motion-clouds"],"title":"Sparse Approximation of Images Inspired from the Functional Architecture of the Primary Visual Areas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Montagnini","Pascal Mamassian","Laurent U Perrinet","Guillaume S Masson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167606000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551652743,"objectID":"4d8ab5deb2e13721270514248d5beea7","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/montagnini-07-b/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/montagnini-07-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that, when the visual information about an object's motion differs on the local (edge-related) and global levels, the local 1D motion cues dominate initially, whereas 2D information takes progressively over and leads to the final correct representation of global motion. Previous models have explained the initial errors (deviations from the global motion) in terms of best perceptual guess in the Bayesian sense. These models accounted for the intrinsic sensory noise of the image and general expectancies for object velocities. Here we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, with the purpose of encompassing the whole dynamical evolution of motion processing, from the 1D cues to the correct global motion. Our model is motivated and constrained by smooth pursuit oculomotor data. Eye movements were recorded in 3 participants using the scleral search coil technique. Participants were asked to track either a single line (vertical or oblique) or a Gaussian blob moving horizontally. In our model, oculomotor data obtained with non ambiguous stimuli (e.g. with coherent local and global information, such as a Gaussian blob or a vertical line moving horizontally) are combined to constrain the initial likelihood and prior functions for the general, ambiguous case (e.g. a tilted line moving horizontally). The prior knowledge is then recursively updated by using the previous posterior probability as the current prior. The idea is that the recursive injection of posterior distribution boosts the spread of information about the object's shape, favoring the integration of 1D and 2D cues. In addition, a simple model of the sensory-oculomotor loop is taken into account, including transmission delays and the evolution of the retinal motion during pursuit. Preliminary results show substantial agreement between the model prediction and the oculomotor data.","tags":["Bayesian model"],"title":"Visual tracking of ambiguous moving objects: A recursive Bayesian model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136070000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551652743,"objectID":"6c266edfd0bb17e3549b6ce62756f687","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-06-cns/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-06-cns/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe the theoretical formulation of a learning algorithm in a model of the primary visual cortex (V1) and present results of the efficiency of this algorithm by comparing it to the SparseNet algorithm (Olshausen, 1996).

But they are also characterized by their efficiency in terms of rapidity and robustness. We propose and study here a model of information integration in the primary visual cortex (V1) thanks to the parallel and interconnected network of similar cortical columns. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of contrast gain control mechanisms as a function of the distribution of information relevance in a small population of cortical columns. This cortical area is modeled as a collection of similar cortical columns which receive input and are linked according to a specific connectivity pattern which is relevant to this area. These columns are simulated using the sc Nest simulator Morrison04 using conductance-based Integrate-and-Fire neurons and consist vertically in 3 different layers. The architecture was inspired by neuro-physiological observations on the influence of neighboring activities on pyramidal cells activity and correlates with the lateral flow of information observed in the primary visual cortex, notably in optical imaging experiments Jancke04, and is similar in its final implementation to local micro-circuitry of the cortical column presented by Grossberg05. % They show prototypical spontaneous dynamical behavior to different levels of noise which are relevant to the generic modeling of biological cortical columns Kremkow05. In the future, the connectivity will be derived from an algorithm that was used for modeling the transient spiking response of a layer of neurons to a flashed image and which was based on the Matching Pursuit algorithm Perrinet04. % The visual input is first transmitted from the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) using the model of Gazeres98. It transforms the image flow into a stream of spikes with contrast gain control mechanisms specific to the retina and the LGN. This spiking activity converges to the pyramidal cells of layer 2/3 thanks to the specification of receptive fields in layer 4 providing a preference for oriented local contrasts in the spatio-temporal visual flow. In particular, we use in these experiments visual input organized in a center-surround spatial pattern which was optimized in size to maximize the response of a column in the center and to the modulation of this response by the surround (bipartite stimulus). This class of stimuli provide different levels of input activation and of visual ambiguity in the visual space which were present in the spatio-temporal correlations in the input spike flow optimized to the resolution of cortical columns in the visual space. It thus provides a method to reveal the dynamics of information integration and particularly of contrast gain control which are characteristic to the function of V1.","tags":["gain control"],"title":"Dynamical contrast gain control mechanisms in a layer 2/3 model of the primary visual cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","Jens Kremkow","Frédéric V.

The linear transform is a complex log-Gabor wavelet transform which is overcomplete (i.e. there are more coefficients than pixels in the image) and has exact reconstruction. The inhibition consists in diminishing down the coefficients which are not at a local-maxima along the direction normal to the edge filter orientation, whereas the facilitation enhances the collinear and co-aligned local-maximum coefficients. At each iteration and after the inhibition and facilitation stages, the reconstructed error is subtracted in the transform domain for keeping an exact reconstruction. Such process concentrates the signal energy on a few coefficients situated along the edges of the objects, yielding a sparse representation. The rationale for such procedure is: (1) th e overcompleteness offers flexibility for activity reassignment; (2) images can be coded by sparse Gabor coefficients located on object edges; (3) image contours produce aligned and collinear local-maxima in the transform domain; (4) the inhibition/facilitation processes are able to extract the contours. The sparse Gabor coefficients are mostly connected each other and located along object contours. Such layout makes chain coding suitable for compression purposes. Specially adapted to Gabor wavelets features, our chain coding represents every chain by its end-points (head and tail) and the elementary movements necessary to walk along the chain from head to tail. Moreover it predicts the module and phase of each Gabor coefficient according to the previous chain coefficient. As a result, redundancy of the transform domain is further reduced. Used for compression, the scheme limits particularly the high-frequency artifacts. The model performs also efficiently in tasks the Human Visual System is supposed to deal with, as for instance edge extraction and image denoising.","tags":["log-gabor"],"title":"Modeling of simple cells through a sparse overcomplete gabor wavelet representation based on local inhibition and facilitation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvain Fischer","Rafael Redondo","Laurent U Perrinet","Gabriel Cristóbal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1119996000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552293228,"objectID":"9c1e343bed181e9a2364a439e968a9ec","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/fischer-05-a/","publishdate":"2005-06-29T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fischer-05-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Efficient sparse coding of overcomplete transforms remains still anopen problem.

The dynamics of this motion integration shows a complex time course which can be read from tracking eye movements: local 1D motion signals are extracted first and then pooled to initiate the ocular responses before that 2D motion signals are taken into account to refine the tracking direction until it matches the surface motion direction. The nature of these 1D and 2D motion computations is still unclear. Previously, we have shown that the late, 2D-driven response components to either plaids or barber-poles have very similar latencies over a large range of contrast, suggesting a shared mechanism. However, they showed different contrast response functions with these different motion stimuli, suggesting different motion processing. We designed a two-pathways Bayesian model of motion integration and showed that this family of contrast response functions can be predicted from the probability distributions of 1D and 2D motion signals for each type of stimulus. Indeed, this formulation may explain contrast response functions that could not be explained by a simple bayesian model (Weiss et al., 2002 em Nature Neuroscience bf 5 , 598--604) and gives a quantitative argument to study how local information with different relative ambiguities values may be pooled to provide an integrated response of the system. Finally, we formulate how different spatial information may be pooled and we draw the analogy of this method with methods using the partial derivative equations.

This representation is here based on a generative linear model of the synthesis of images using an over-complete multi-resolution dictionary of edges. This transform is implemented using log-Gabor filters and permits an exact reconstruction of any image. However, this linear representation is redundant and since to any image may correspond different representations, we explore more efficient representations of the image. The problem is stated as an ill-posed inverse problem and we compare first different known strategies by computing the efficiency of the solutions given by Matching Pursuit (Perrinet, 2004, IEEE Trans. Neural Networks 15 1164-75) and sparse edge coding (Fischer, in press, Trans. Image Processing) with classical representation methods such as JPEG. This comparison allows us to provide a synthesized approach using a probabilistic representation which would progressively construct the neural representation by using lateral cooperations. We propose an algorithm which dynamically diffuses information to correlated filters so as to yield a progressively disambiguated representation. This approach takes advantage of the computational properties of spiking neurons such as Integrate-and-Fire neurons and provides an efficient yet simple model for the representation of natural images. This representation is directly linked with the edge content of natural images and we show applications of this method to edge extraction, denoising and compression.

These analog values activate a set of spiking neurons which each fire once to produce an asynchronous wave of spikes. According to this model, the image may be progressively reconstructed from this spike wave thanks to regularities in the statistics of the coefficients determined with natural images. Here, we study mathematically how the quality of information transmission carried by this temporal representation varies over time. In particular, we study how these regularities can be used to optimize information transmission by using a form of temporal cooperation of neurons to code analog values. The original model used wavelet transforms that are close to orthogonal. However, the selectivity of realistic neurons overlap, and we propose an extension of the previous model by adding a spatial cooperation between filters. This model extends the previous scheme for arbitrary ---and possibly non-orthogonal--- representations of features in the images.

Even though it is simplistic, this trans- formation of spatial data into a spatio-temporal pattern of binary events provides an accurate description of some complex neural patterns observed in the spiking activity of biological neural networks.","tags":["Bayesian model","coding decoding","matching pursuit","sparse coding","sparse hebbian learning","spike"],"title":"Feature detection using spikes : the greedy approach.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet","Manuel Samuelides","Simon J Thorpe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1079478000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560787216,"objectID":"05e3afe1ae15d35c01d9337299e21efd","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-02-sparse/","publishdate":"2004-03-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-02-sparse/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["association field","matching pursuit","sparse coding"],"title":"Sparse spike coding in an asynchronous feed-forward multi-layer neural network using matching pursuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1074294000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560787216,"objectID":"ed4b6c8e5fb952d54a4735a2c8ecd8dd","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-04/","publishdate":"2004-01-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-04/","section":"publication","summary":"To understand possible strategies of temporal spike coding in the central nervous system, we study functional neuromimetic models of visual processing for static images. We will first present the retinal model which was introduced by Van Rullen and Thorpe [1] and which represents the multi- scale contrast values of the image using an orthonormal wavelet transform. These analog values activate a set of spiking neurons which each fire once to produce an asynchronous wave of spikes. According to this model, the image may be progressively reconstructed from this spike wave thanks to regularities in the statistics of the coefficients determined with natural images. Here, we study mathematically how the quality of information transmission carried by this temporal representation varies over time. In particular, we study how these regularities can be used to optimize information transmission by using a form of temporal cooperation of neurons to code analog values. The original model used wavelet transforms that are close to orthogonal. However, the selectivity of realistic neurons overlap, and we propose an extension of the previous model by adding a spatial cooperation between filters. This model extends the previous scheme for arbitrary ---and possibly non-orthogonal--- representations of features in the images. In particular, we compared the perfor- mance of increasingly over-complete representations in the retina. Results show that this algorithm provides an efficient spike coding strategy for low-level visual processing which may adapt to the complexity of the visual input.","tags":["area-v1","sparselets","unsupervised learning"],"title":"Finding Independent Components using spikes : a natural result of hebbian learning in a sparse spike coding scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurent U Perrinet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041375600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553246533,"objectID":"38073671c0b6396eeaa07e932fb80d62","permalink":"https://laurentperrinet.github.io/publication/perrinet-03-these/","publishdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perrinet-03-these/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["stdp"],"title":"Comment déchiffrer le code impulsionnel de la vision ?

As a first step, we will study the learning of a layer of realistic neurons in the particular case where the relevant messages are formed by temporally cor- related patterns, or synfire patterns. The model is a layer of Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neurons with synaptic current dynamics that adapts by minimizing a cost according to a gradient descent scheme. This leads to a rule similar to Spike-Time Dependent Hebbian Plasticity (STDHP). Our results show that the rule that we derive is biologically plausible and leads to the detection of the coherence in the input in an unsupervised way.

Strong TC synapses have been one suggestion to ensure the strength of the TC projection (s̈trong-synapse model̈̇ Another possibility is that the excitation from single thalamic fibers are weak but get amplified by recurrent excitatory feedback in layer 4 (p̈̈lifier modelB̈̈runo and Sakmann [2] recently provided new evidence that individual TC synapses in vivo are weak and only produce small excitatory postsynaptic potentials. However, they suggested that thalamic input can activate the cortex due to the synchronous firing and that cortical amplification is not required. This would support the ̈̈ö̈ny models̈̈̈ed by correlation analysis [3]. Here, we studied the effect of correlation in the TC input, with weak synapses, to the responses of a layered cortical network model. The connectivity of the layered network was taken from Binzegger et al. 2004 [4]. The network was simulated using NEST [5] with the Python interface PyNN [6] to enable interoperability with different simulators. The sensory input to layer 4 was modelled by a simple retino-geniculate model of the transformation of light into spike trains [7], which was implemented by leaky integrate-and-fire model neurons. We found that introducing correlation into TC inputs enhanced the likelihood to produce responses in layer 4 and improved the activity propagation across layers. In addition, we compared the response of the cortical network to different noise conditions and obtained contrast response functions which were in accordance with neurophysiological observations.
