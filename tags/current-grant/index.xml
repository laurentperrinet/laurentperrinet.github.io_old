      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the field of neuroscience, modeling has long made it possible to validate and predict theories of information processing in the neural networks that make up the brain. The recent emergence of solutions inherited from machine learning, in particular deep learning, has changed the field since 2012. One reason for the effectiveness of these methods is the amount of data analyzed but above all the ability to teach these algorithms on dedicated architectures, including graphics cards (GPUs). Indeed, this architecture allows an algorithm to be parallelized into a multitude of simple and independent subprograms that allow speed gains of around 6x to 10x to be achieved over traditional visual information processing architectures. We are now using these architectures excessively to test new image processing models - targeting applications in both neuroscience and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dans le domaine des neurosciences, la modélisation a longtemps permis d&amp;rsquo;effectuer des validations et prédictions sur les théories du traitement de l&amp;rsquo;information dans les réseaux de neurones qui constitue le cerveau. L&#39;émergence récente de solutions héritées de l&amp;rsquo;apprentissage machine, en particulier l&amp;rsquo;apprentissage profond (Deep Learning) est venu bouleverser le champ depuis 2012. Une raison de l&amp;rsquo;efficacité de ces méthodes est la quantité de données analysées mais surtout la capacité de faire apprendre ces algorithmes sur des architectures dédiées, notamment les cartes graphiques (GPU). En effet cette architecture permet de paralléliser un algorithme en une multitude de sous programmes simples et indépendants qui permettent d&amp;rsquo;atteindre des gains de vitesse de l&amp;rsquo;ordre de 6x à 10x sur des architectures classiques de traitement de l&amp;rsquo;information visuelle. Nous utilisons maintenant excessivement ces architectures pour tester de nouveaux modèles de traitement des images - en visant des applications  aussi bien aux neurosciences qu&amp;rsquo;en apprentissage machine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>APROVIS3D: Analog PROcessing of bioinspired VIsion Sensors for 3D reconstruction (2019/2023)</title>

&lt;li&gt;Le projet APROVIS3D est lauréat de l&amp;rsquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chistera.eu/projects/aprovis3d&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;appel à projets 2018 &lt;em&gt;CHIST-ERA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APROVIS3D project targets analog computing for artificial intelligence in the form of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on a mixed analog and digital architecture. The project includes including field programmable analog array (FPAA) and SpiNNaker applied to a stereopsis system dedicated to coastal surveillance using an aerial robot. Computer vision systems widely rely on artificial intelligence and especially neural network based machine learning, which recently gained huge visibility. The training stage for deep convolutional neural networks is both time and energy consuming. In contrast, the human brain has the ability to perform visual tasks with unrivalled computational and energy efficiency. It is believed that one major factor of this efficiency is the fact that information is vastly represented by short pulses (spikes) at analog – not discrete – times. However, computer vision algorithms using such representation still lack in practice, and its high potential is largely underexploited. Inspired from biology, the project addresses the scientific question of developing a low-power, end-to-end analog sensing and processing architecture of 3D visual scenes, running on analog devices, without a central clock and aims to validate them in real-life situations. More specifically, the project will develop new paradigms for biologically inspired vision, from sensing to processing, in order to help machines such as Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAV), autonomous vehicles, or robots gain high-level understanding from visual scenes. The ambitious long-term vision of the project is to develop the next generation AI paradigm that will eventually compete with deep learning. We believe that neuromorphic computing, mainly studied in EU countries, will be a key technology in the next decade. It is therefore both a scientific and strategic challenge for the EU to foster this technological breakthrough. The consortium from four EU countries offers a unique combination of expertise that the project requires. SNNs specialists from various fields, such as visual sensors (IMSE, Spain), neural network architecture and computer vision (Uni. of Lille, France) and computational neuroscience (INT, France) will team up with robotics and automatic control specialists (NTUA, Greece), and low power integrated systems designers (ETHZ, Switzerland) to help geoinformatics researchers (UNIWA, Greece) build a demonstrator UAV for coastal surveillance (TRL5). Adding up to the shared interest regarding analog based computing and computer vision, all team members have a lot to offer given their different and complementary points of view and expertise. Key challenges of this project will be end-to-end analog system design (from sensing to AI-based control of the UAV and 3D coastal volumetric reconstruction), energy efficiency, and practical usability in real conditions. We aim to show that such a bioinspired analog design will bring large benefits in terms of power efficiency, adaptability and efficiency needed to make coastal surveillance with UAVs practical and more efficient than digital approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humans have an extraordinary capacity to infer cause-effect relations. In particular, we excel in forming ​beliefs ​about the ​causal effect of actions​. Causal learning provides the basis for rational decision-making and allows people to engage in meaningful life and social interactions. Causal learning is a form of goal-directed learning, defined as the capacity to rapidly learn the consequence of actions and to select behaviours according to goals and motivational state. This ability is based on internal models of the consequence of our behaviors​ and relies on learning rules determined by the​ contingency between actions and outcomes​. At a first approximation, contingency Δ​P ​is operationalized as the difference between two conditional probabilities: i) P(O|A), the probability of outcome O given action A; ii) P(O|¬A), the probability of the outcome when the action is withheld. In everyday life, people perceive their actions as causing a given outcome if the contingency is positive, whereas they perceive them as preventing​ ​it​ ​if​ ​negative;​ ​when​ ​P(O|A)​ ​and​ ​P(O|¬A)​ ​are​ ​equal,​ ​people​ ​report​ ​no​ ​causal​ ​effect​​ ​. Despite the centrality of causal learning, a clear understanding of both the internal computations and neural substrates (the so-called ​cognitive architectures​) is currently missing. ​Our project will therefore address​ ​two​ ​key​ ​questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the key ​internal representations of causal beliefs and what are the ​computational processes​​ ​that​ ​enable​ ​their​ ​formation​ ​during​ ​learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How ​​are ​​internal​ ​representations​ ​and ​​computational​​ processes​ ​​implemented​ ​​in ​​the ​​brain? CausaL​ ​​will​ ​address​ ​these​ ​two​ ​objectives​ ​through​ ​two​ ​dedicated​ ​research​ ​work​ ​packages​ ​(WPs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>ANR Horizontal-V1 (2017/2021)</title>
      <link>https://laurentperrinet.github.io/grant/anr-horizontal-v1/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description on the official website of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE37-0006&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ANR&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Horizontal-V1 project aims at understanding the emergence of sensory predictions linking local shape attributes (orientation, contour) to global indices of movement (direction, speed, trajectory) at the earliest stage of cortical processing (primary visual cortex, i.e. V1). We will study how the long-distance &amp;ldquo;horizontal&amp;rdquo; connectivity, intrinsic to V1 and the feedback from higher cortical areas contribute to a dynamic processing of local-to-global features as a function of the context (eg displacement along a trajectory; during reafference change induced by eye-movements&amp;hellip;). We will search to characterize the dynamic processes based on lateral propagation intra-V1, through which spatio-temporal inferences (continuous movement or apparent motion sequences) facilitating spatial (&amp;ldquo;filling-in&amp;rdquo;) or positional (&amp;ldquo;flash-lag&amp;rdquo;) future expected responses may be generated. The project will use a variety of animations of local oriented stimuli forming, according to their spatial and temporal coherence, predictable global patterns, apparent motion sequences and/or continuous trajectories. We will measure the cortical dynamics at two scales of neuronal integration, from micro- (intracellular, SUA) to meso-scopic levels (multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSDI)) in the anesthetized (cat, marmoset) and awake fixating animal (macaca mulata). In a second step, we will combine these multiscale observations to constrain a structuro-functional model of low-level perception, integrating the micro-meso constraints. Two laboratories will participate in synergy to the project: UNIC-Gif (Dir. Yves Frégnac, DRCE2 CNRS, coordinator) and INT-Marseille (NeOpTo Team Dir. Frédéric Chavane, DR2 CNRS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wp3---design-of-novel-visual-paradigms-probabilistic-model-of-v1-and-data-driven-simulations---co-lead-unic-int&#34;&gt;WP3 - Design of novel visual paradigms, probabilistic model of V1 and data-driven simulations - co lead UNIC-INT.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives : This WP will have two primary goals. The first one is theoretically driven, and for sake of simplicity will ignore the dynamic features of neural integration (as expected from a statistical model of image analysis). Binding the different features of visual objects at the local scale (contours) as well as a more global level involves understanding the statistical regularities of the sensory inflow. In particular, titrating the predictions that can be done at the statistical level can be seen as a first pass to better search for critical parameters constraining the network behaviour. From these, we will build probabilistic predictive models optimized for edge co-occurrence classification and generate novel visual statistics 1) which obey rules imposed by the functional horizontal connectivity anisotropies, such as co- circularity, and 2) which facilitate binding in the orientation domain, such as log-polar planforms. These statistics generated in the first half of the grant will be implemented and tested experimentally in the second half of the grant. The second one is more data-driven (as well as phenomenological for feedback from higher cortical areas, since it will not be explored in the grant). Since model fitting will depend on close interactions with WP1 and WP2 measurements, it will be done in the second half of the grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wp3-task-1-theoretically-oriented-workplan--lead-int-laurent-perrinet&#34;&gt;WP3-Task 1: Theoretically oriented workplan – Lead INT (Laurent Perrinet)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP3-Task 1.1 - theory : we will exploit our current expertise in integrating these statistics in the form of probabilistic models to make predictions both at the physiological and modelling levels. First, we will take advantage of our previous work on the quantification of the association field in different classes of natural images (Perrinet &amp;amp; Bednar, 2015). Using an existing library (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bicv/SparseEdges),&#34;&gt;https://github.com/bicv/SparseEdges),&lt;/a&gt; we will use the sparse representation of static natural images to compute histograms of edge co-occurrences. Using an existing algorithm for unsupervised learning (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bicv/SparseHebbianLearning),&#34;&gt;https://github.com/bicv/SparseHebbianLearning),&lt;/a&gt; we will learn the different independent components of edge co-occurrences. Such an algorithm fits well a traditional deep-learning convolutional neural network, but, in addition, will include constraints imposed by intra-layer horizontal connectivity. We expect that relevant features will be co-linear or co-circular pairs of edges, but also T-junctions or end-stopping features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP3-Task 1.2 - image/film synthesis : We have previously found that random synthetic textures, coined &amp;ldquo;Motion Clouds&amp;rdquo;, can be used to quantify V1 implication in visual motion perception (Leon et al, 2012; Simoncini et al, 2012). Recently, the INT and UNIC, partners proved mathematically that these stimuli were optimal with respect to some common geometrical transformations, such as translation, zoom or rotations (Vacher et al, 2015). A main characteristic of these textures is to be generated with a maximally entropic arrangement of elementary textures (so-called textons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**        Informed by the generative model of edge co-occurrences studied in subtask 1, we will be able to extend the family of motion cloud stimuli (Leon et al, 2012; Simoncini et al, 2012) to include joint dependencies between different elements in position or orientation. An exact solution to this problem is hard to achieve as it involves a combinatorial search of all possible combinations of pairs of edges. However, numerous variational approaches are possible and fit well with our probabilistic framework. We will use the convolutional neural network described above but using a back-propagating stream to generate different images. Such a representation will then be optimized using an unsupervised learning method. This is similar to the process used in Generative Adversarial Networks in deep-learning architectures (Radford et al, Archives).
**        Finally, the regularities observed in static images will be extended to dynamical scenes by observing that a co-occurrence can be implemented by simple geometrical operations as they are operated in time. For instance a co-circularity is easily described as the set of smooth roto-translational transformations of an edge in time using the group of Galilean transformations (Sarti and Citti, 2006). This theory calls for a first prediction to understand the set of whole possible spatio-temporal co-occurrences of edges as geodesics in the lifted space of all possible trajectories. We predict that such decomposition should allow us to better understand the different classes of features that emerged in the first task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WP3-Task 1.3 - Feedback of theory on experimentation : An essential aspect of this work would be to apply these stimuli in neurophysiological experiments and in the modelling. In particular, the ability to select different types of dependencies from the different classes learned above (for instance, co-circularities of a certain curvature range) will make it possible to evaluate the relative contribution of different components of the contextual information. This justifies the fact that the WP3 post-doctoral fellow should have the mobility (between INT and UNIC) and multi-disciplinar profile (theoretical and experimental) to perform this task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WP3-Task 1.4 - Generic modelling : These various subtasks will allow us to determine the hierarchy of critical features relevant to describe the full statistics of the space of spatio-temporal edge co-occurrences. Indeed, in static images, we will be able to find independent component in the histograms of edge co-occurrences between metric aspect (distance or scale between edge) from configurational aspects (difference of angle or co-circularity angle).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we expect to see that the different independent features should decompose at various scales both in space and in time. For instance, we expect configurational aspects to be more local while aspects related to a motion (Perrinet and Masson, 2012; Khoei et al, 2016) or global shape (form) should be more global. This translates into a probabilistic hierarchical model that would combine dependencies from different cues. In particular, through the emergence of differential pathways for form and motion. These quantitative predictions should finally be confronted at the modelling and neurophysiological levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wp3-task-2--data-driven-comprehensive-model-of-v1--co-lead-unic-and-int&#34;&gt;WP3-Task 2 : Data-driven comprehensive model of V1 – Co-lead UNIC and INT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second task is more data-driven (as well as phenomenological for the feedback circuit part, since largely unknown). Since simulations will depend on close interactions with WP1 and WP2 measurements, it will be developed by the WP3-Post-Doc in the second half of the grant. It will benefit from existing structuro-functional models addressing separately two distinct levels of neural integration, microscopic (conductance-based in Kremkow et al, 2016; Antolik et al, submitted, Chariker et al, 2016) and mesoscopic (VSD-like mean field in Rankin and Chavane, 2017). Efforts will be made to merge these models to fit - in a unified multiscale biologically realistic model - the cellular and VSD data targeting critically horizontal propagation. The parameterization should be flexible enough to produce a generic cortical architecture accounting possibly for species-specificity (Antolik for cat; Chaliker for monkey)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The objectives of PREDICTEYE is to rigorously test and define the functional and neurophysiological grounds of probabilistic oculomotor internal models by investigating the multiple timescales at which the trajectory of a moving target is learned and represented in a probabilistic framework (Aim #1). Second, we will investigate the role of (pre)frontal oculomotor networks in building such probabilistic representations and their impact upon two of their downstream neural targets of the brainstem premotor centers (superior colliculus for saccades; NRTP for pursuit) (Aim #2). Our third objective is to model and simulate the dynamics of target motion prediction and eye movement performance. A key question is to unveil how probabilistic information about target timing and motion (i.e. direction and speed) is sampled over trial history by neuronal populations and integrated with Prior knowledge (i.e. sequence properties and rules of conditional probabilities) in order to coordinate saccades and pursuit and optimize their precisions (Aim #3).&lt;/p&gt;
