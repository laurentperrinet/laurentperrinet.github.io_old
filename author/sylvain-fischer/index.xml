(a) Schematic contours of the log-Gabor filters in the Fourier domain with 5 scales and 8 orientations (only the contours at 78% of the filter maximum are drawn). (b) The real part of the corresponding filters is drawn in the spatial domain. The two first scales are drawn at the bottom magnified by a factor of 4 for a better visualization. The different scales are arranged in rows and the orientations in columns. The low-pass filter is drawn in the upper-left part. (c) The corresponding imaginary parts of the filters are shown in the same arrangement. Note that the low-pass filter does not have imaginary part. Insets (b) and (c) show the final filters built through all the processes described in Section 2. (d) In the proposed scheme the elongation of log-Gabor wavelets increases with the number of orientations nt . Here the real parts (left column) and imaginary parts (right column) are drawn for the 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 orientation schemes. (e) As a comparison orthogonal wavelet filters ‘Db4’ are shown. Horizontal, vertical and diagonal wavelets are arranged on columns (low-pass on top). (f) As a second comparison, steerable pyramid filters (Portilla et al., 2003) are shown. The arrangement over scales and orientations is the same as for the log-Gabor scheme.&#34;&gt;

Simple cortical cells are modeled through log-Gabor functions. They are organized in pairs in quadrature of phase (dark-gray circles). For each position the set of different orientations compose a pinwheel (large light-gray circles). The retinotopic organization induces that adjacent spatial positions are arranged in adjacent pinwheels. Inhibition interactions occur towards the closest adjacent positions which are in the direc-tions perpendicular to the cell preferred orientation and toward adjacent orientations (light-red connections). Facilitation occurs to-wards co-aligned cells up to a larger distance (dark-blue connections).&#34;&gt;
