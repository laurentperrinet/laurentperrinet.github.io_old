 abstract = {In most mammals, the primary visual cortex (V1) processes complex mixtures of orientations to construct an accurate neural representation of our visual environment. Sparse coding has been used to model the emergence of orientation-selective localized receptive fields and in particular the diversity of their shapes which reflects the richness of textures found in natural images. However, it is not yet known whether the corresponding sparse coefficients follow consistent patterns in natural images. Here, we explored the statistics of the distribution of sparse coefficients extracted from a sequence of images in a database of natural scenes. We first replicated previous results showing that sparse coefficients decrease with prototypical shapes. Then, we extended these results by showing the dependence of sparse coefficients on their relative position but also on the inverse variance of their orientation selectivity, that is, its precision. This demonstrates that orientation precision is an important variable in the encoding of visual information. The analysis also showed that different precisions followed different dynamics, a prior information which could be further exploited in a dynamical model. This model-based hypothesis is finally confronted with neurophysiological recordings made in V1.},
