We stand at a point in history where our phones have become smart but
lack a feature which prevails in most forms of living intelligence:
vision. The ability to see is indeed an essential facet of intelligence
which is developed in an autonomous manner even in young human infants.
I will focus here on a particular problem: how do we estimate motion in
a visual image? I will explain why for this problem, it is crucial to
understand how the visual system might overcome temporal delays and will
demonstrate at different levels of description ---from probabilistic
models to neuromorphic hardware---  a surprising solution: The visual
system models the world and uses the eye to probe this model},
