We stand at a point in history where our phones have become smart but 
lack a feature which prevails in most forms of living intelligence: 
vision. The ability to see is indeed an essential facet of intelligence 
which is developed in an autonomous manner even in young human infants. 
I will focus here on a particular problem: how do we estimate motion in 
a visual image? I will explain why for this problem, it is crucial to 
understand how the visual system might overcome temporal delays and will 
demonstrate at different levels of description ---from probabilistic 
models to neuromorphic hardware---  a surprising solution: The visual 
system models the world and uses the eye to probe this model},
