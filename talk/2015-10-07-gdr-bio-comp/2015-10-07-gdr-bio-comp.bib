 abstract = {We stand at a point in history where our phones have become smart but lack a feature which prevails in most forms of living intelligence: vision. The ability to see is indeed an essential facet of intelligence which is developed in an autonomous manner even in young human infants. I will focus here on a particular problem: how do we estimate motion in a visual image? I will explain why for this problem, it is crucial to understand how the visual system might overcome temporal delays and will demonstrate at different levels of description ---from probabilistic models to neuromorphic hardware---  a surprising solution: The visual system models the world and uses the eye to probe this model.},
