 note = {* Here, I talk about how we aim at "compiling" such models as neural networks and as parallel wafer systems in the BrainscaleS project (Demo 1, Task4). (1) I give 3 examples of models (Bayesian or neural) and how we may translate them in a pyNN + ESS compatible implementation (2) we will show how these can be validated by behavioral data collected at the lab but also do some predictions. * [[attachment:perrinet11brainscales_talk.pdf|slides]] * (private to the consortium: [[https://brainscales.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/internal/jss/AttendMeeting?m=showMeetingInfoPage&meetingID=15|meeting info]] &[[https://brainscales.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/internal/jss/AttendMeeting?m=showAgenda&meetingID=15|Agenda]], including copies of the slides)},
