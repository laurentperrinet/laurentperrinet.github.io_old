Moving the eyes rapidly to track a visual object moving in a cluttered environment is an essential
function. However, doing so rapidly and efficiently is constrained by a number of noise sources in the
visual system and by the fact that information is collected locally before giving raise to a global signal.
After reviewing some results made in the modeling of low-level sensory areas, I will expose a method
to decode low-level neural information as describing visual information using a probabilistic
representation. Decisions will therefore correspond to statistical inferences which are dynamically
resolving the veridical speed of a moving object. We will illustrate this method by showing how
ambiguous local information can be merged to give raise to a global response which resolves the
aperture problem. Using this theoretical approach "in computo", we will illustrate how we may better
understand results which are observed "in vivo" (optical imaging) as a neural code linking actively
sensation and behavior.},
