 abstract = {In low-level sensory systems, it is still unclear how the noisy information collected locally by neurons may give rise to a coherent global percept. This is well demonstrated for the detection of motion in the aperture problem: as luminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential velocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our implementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic representation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to the aperture problem similar to psychophysics and behavior. We demonstrate that this solution is the result of  two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features independently of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are explained away while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global scale. Most previous models included ad-hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped cells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features. Here, we have proved that motion-based predictive coding, as it is  implemented in this functional model, is sufficient to solve the aperture problem. This simpler solution may give insights in the role of prediction underlying a large class of sensory computations.  },

The sequence in which a set of local motion is shown is essential for the detection of global motion. we replicate here the experiments by Scott Watamaniuk and colleagues. They have shown behaviourally that a dot in noise is much more detectable when it follows a coherent trajectory, up to an order of magnitude of 10 times what would be predicted by the local components of the trajectory. ''(Left)'' In this first movie we observe white noise and at first sight, no information is detectable. In fact, there is a dot moving along some smooth linear trajectory, but we broke this trajectory into eight equal parts and shuffled their order in the movie. ''(Right)'' if we re-arrange these local motions to be compatible with a predictive sequence, it is much easier to see the dot (from left to right in the top 25% line of the image, a smooth, slow pursuit helps to catch it). This simple experiment shows that, even if local motion is similar in both movies, a coherent trajectory is more easy to track. Obviously, we may thus conclude that the whole trajectory is more that its individual parts, and that the independence hypothesis does not hold if we want to account for the predictive information in input sequences such as seems to be crucial for the AP. || ## from},
