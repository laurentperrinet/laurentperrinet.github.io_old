 abstract = {Sensory informations such as visual images are inherently variable. We use probabilistic models to describe how the low-level visual system could describe superposed and ambiguous information. This allows to describe the interactions of neighboring populations of neurons as inference rules that dynamically build up the overall description of the visual scene. We focus here on temporal prediction, that is by the transport of information based on an estimate of local motion in the image.},

''(Top)'' In order to demonstrate that, I show in this sequence different apertures; for the aperture problem, motions are segregated (appear to be part of different objects) and still appear to be diagonal. ''(Right)'' However, if the same apertures are arranged in an order which is compatible with a predictive sequence, the horizontal motion appears as the most probable: prediction rotates the perception of the direction... ||},
