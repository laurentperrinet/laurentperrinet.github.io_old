 abstract = {Moving objects generate sensory information that may be noisy and ambiguous, yet it is important to be able to reconstruct object speed as fast as possible. One unsolved question is to understand how the brain pools motion information to give an efficient response. I will present computational models of motion detection in the visual system that try to answer this question. First, sensory information is grabbed by pooling the information from different sensory neurons. This pooling is modulated by the precision of information and we will present some recent model-based behavioural results. Then I will focus on a novel model of motion-based prediction that allows to track objects on smooth trajectories. This model gives an economical description of neural mechanisms associated with the processing underlying motion detection. Finally, we will propose an exploratory hypothesis such that eye movements may be understood as the prospective response to this dynamical sensory response knowing oculomotor constraints such as delays. This line of research aims at showing that through the convergent use of models, electrophysiology or behavioural responses, the study of motion detection is an essential tool in our understanding of neural computations.},

The central nervous system has to contend with axonal delays, both at the sensory and the motor levels. For instance, in the human visuo-oculomotor system, it takes approximately $τ_s=50~\ms$ for the retinal image to reach the visual areas implicated in motion detection, and a further $τ_m=40~\ms $ to reach the oculomotor muscles. As a consequence, for a tennis player trying to intercept a ball at a speed of $20~\m· \s^-1$, the sensed physical position is $1~\m$ behind the true position (as represented here by $τ_s · ěcV$), while the position at the moment of emitting the motor command will be $.8~\m$ ahead of its execution ($τ_m · ̧̌V$). Note that while the actual position of the ball when its image hits photoreceptors on the retina is approximately at $45$ degrees of eccentricity (red dotted line), the player's gaze is directed to the ball at its \emphpresent position (red line), in anticipatory fashion. Optimal control directs action (future motion of the eye) to the expected position (red dashed line) of the ball in the future --- and the racket (black dashed line) to the expected position of the ball when motor commands reach the periphery (muscles). || Time:: January 10th, 2014, 11:30am Location:: CAV/LPP - 45 rue des Saints Pères - salle H432},
