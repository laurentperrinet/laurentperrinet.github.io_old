 abstract = {This session aims at presenting new ideas that emerged during the first years of BrainScaleS. Indeed,
the collaborations that were initiated within the consortium led to the creation of novel tools as
planned in the proposal but also some of which were unforeseen, like the Motion Clouds that we
presented previously. We present here some prototypical and inspiring examples of such
collaborative work on: 1) tool chains from experimental (Davison), computational (Antolik) or integrative (Petrovici)
perspectives, 2) original methods inspired by novel types of analysis for propagating waves (Schmidt, Muller) or by
novel magnetrodes (Pannetier Lecoeur).},
