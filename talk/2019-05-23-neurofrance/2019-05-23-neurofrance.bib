 abstract = {Animal behavior has to constantly adapt to changes in the environment, for instance when a contextual probabilistic variable switches its state. For an agent interacting with this kind of volatile environment, it is important to respond to such switches accurately and with the shortest delay. However, this operation has in general to be performed in presence of noisy sensory inputs and solely based on the information accumulated at the present time. It has already been shown that human observers can accurately anticipate a target's motion direction with their eye movements throughout random sequences of rightward/leftward motions with a bias in direction probability. Here, we tested the ability of these observers to anticipate different random biases within random-length contextual blocks. Experimental results were compared to those of a probabilistic agent which is optimal with respect to this switching model. We found a better fit between the behaviorally observed anticipatory response with that of the probabilistic agent compared to other models such as a leaky integrator model. Moreover, we could similarly fit the level of confidence given by human observers with that provided by the model and draw a common marker for subject inter-variability, titrating their level of preference between exploration and exploitation. Such results provide evidence that human observers may efficiently represent an internal belief for motion direction bias, along with its precision, and use this representation for sensorimotor control as well as for explicit judgments. This work proposes a novel approach to more generically test human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.},
