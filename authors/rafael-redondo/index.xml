Simple cortical cells are mod-eled through log-Gabor functions. They are organized in pairs inquadrature of phase (dark-gray circles). For each position the setof different orientations compose a pinwheel (large light-gray cir-cles). The retinotopic organization induces that adjacent spatial po-sitions are arranged in adjacent pinwheels. Inhibition interactionsoccur towards the closest adjacent positions which are in the direc-tions perpendicular to the cell preferred orientation and toward ad-jacent orientations (light-red connections). Facilitation occurs to-wards coaligned cells up to a larger distance (dark-blue connec-tions).&#34;&gt;
