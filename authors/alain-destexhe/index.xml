      <description>Traveling waves have recently been observed in different animal species, brain areas and behavioral states. However, it is still unclear what are their functional roles. In the case of cortical visual processing, waves propagate across retinotopic maps and can hereby generate interactions between spatially and temporally separated instances of feedforward driven activity. Such interactions could participate in processing long-range apparent motion stimuli, an illusion for which no clear neuronal mechanisms have yet been proposed. Using this paradigm in awake monkeys, we show that suppressive traveling waves produce to a spatio-temporal normalization of apparent motion stimuli. Our study suggests that cortical waves shape the representation of illusory moving stimulus within retinotopic maps for an straightforward read-out by downstream areas.</description>
