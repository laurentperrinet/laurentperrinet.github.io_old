When a visual stimulus moves along a continuous trajectory, it may be seen ahead of its veridical position with respect to an unpredictable event such as a punctuate flash. This illusion tells us something important about the visual system: contrary to classical computers, neural activity travels at a relatively slow speed. It is largely accepted that the resulting delays cause this perceived spatial lag of the flash. Still, after several decades of debates, there is no consensus regarding the underlying mechanisms.&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Researchers from the Timone Institute of Neurosciences bring a new theoretical hypothesis on a visual illusion discovered at the beginning of the 20th century. This illusion remained misunderstood while it poses fundamental questions about how our brains represent events in space and time. This study published on January 26, 2017 in the journal PLOS Computational Biology, shows that the solution lies in the predictive mechanisms intrinsic to the neural processing of information.&lt;/strong&gt;

Visual illusions are still popular: in a quasi-magical way, they can make objects appear where they are not expected&amp;hellip; They are also excellent opportunities to question the constraints of our perceptual system. Many illusions are based on motion, such as the flash-lag effect. Observe a luminous dot that moves along a rectilinear trajectory. If a second light dot is flashed very briefly just above the first, the moving point will always be perceived in front of the flash while they are vertically aligned.

Diagonal Markov chain. In the current study, the estimated state vector z = {x, y, u, v} is composed of the 2D position (x and y) and velocity (u and v) of a (moving) stimulus. (A) First, we extend a classical Markov chain using Nijhawan’s diagonal model in order to take into account the known neural delay τ: At time t, information is integrated until time t − τ, using a Markov chain and a model of state transitions p(zt|zt−δt) such that one can infer the state until the last accessible information p(zt−τ|I0:t−τ). This information can then be “pushed” forward in time by predicting its trajectory from t − τ to t. In particular p(zt|I0:t−τ) can be predicted by the same internal model by using the state transition at the time scale of the delay, that is, p(zt|zt−τ). This is virtually equivalent to a motion extrapolation model but without sensory measurements during the time window between t − τ and t. Note that both predictions in this model are based on the same model of state transitions. (B) One can write a second, equivalent “pull” mode for the diagonal model. Now, the current state is directly estimated based on a Markov chain on the sequence of delayed estimations. While being equivalent to the push-mode described above, such a direct computation allows to more easily combine information from areas with different delays. Such a model implements Nijhawan’s “diagonal model”, but now motion information is probabilistic and therefore, inferred motion may be modulated by the respective precisions of the sensory and internal representations. (C) Such a diagonal delay compensation can be demonstrated in a two-layered neural network including a source (input) and a target (predictive) layer [44]. The source layer receives the delayed sensory information and encodes both position and velocity topographically within the different retinotopic maps of each layer. For the sake of simplicity, we illustrate only one 2D map of the motions (x, v). The integration of coherent information can either be done in the source layer (push mode) or in the target layer (pull mode). Crucially, to implement a delay compensation in this motion-based prediction model, one may simply connect each source neuron to a predictive neuron corresponding to the corrected position of stimulus (x &amp;#43; v ⋅ τ, v) in the target layer. The precision of this anisotropic connectivity map can be tuned by the width of convergence from the source to the target populations. Using such a simple mapping, we have previously shown that the neuronal population activity can infer the current position along the trajectory despite the existence of neural delays.&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

The precision of this anisotropic connectivity map can be tuned by the width of convergence from the source to the target populations. Using such a simple mapping, we have previously shown that the neuronal population activity can infer the current position along the trajectory despite the existence of neural delays.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

Processing visual information takes time and even if these delays are remarkably short, they are not negligible and the nervous system must compensate them. For an object that moves predictably, the neural network can infer its most probable position taking into account this processing time. For the flash, however, this prediction can not be established because its appearance is unpredictable. Thus, while the two targets are aligned on the retina at the time of the flash, the position of the moving object is anticipated by the brain to compensate for the processing time: it is this differentiated treatment that causes the flash-lag effect.
The researchers show that this hypothesis also makes it possible to explain the cases where this illusion does not work: for example if the flash appears at the end of the moving dot&amp;rsquo;s trajectory or if the target reverses its path in an unexpected way. In this work, the major innovation is to use the accuracy of information in the dynamics of the model. Thus, the corrected position of the moving target is calculated by combining the sensory flux with the internal representation of the trajectory, both of which exist in the form of probability distributions. To manipulate the trajectory is to change the precision and therefore the relative weight of these two information when they are optimally combined in order to know where an object is at the present time. The researchers propose to call parodiction (from the ancient Greek paron, the present) this new theory that joins Bayesian inference with taking into account neuronal delays.

Histogram of the estimated positions as a function of time for the dMBP model. Histograms of the inferred horizontal positions (blueish bottom panel) and horizontal velocity (reddish top panel), as a function of time frame, from the dMBP model. Darker levels correspond to higher probabilities, while a light color corresponds to an unlikely estimation. We highlight three successive epochs along the trajectory, corresponding to the flash initiated, standard (mid-point) and flash terminated cycles. The timing of the flashes are respectively indicated by the dashed vertical lines. In dark, the physical time and in green the delayed input knowing τ = 100 ms. Histograms are plotted at two different levels of our model in the push mode. The left-hand column illustrates the source layer that corresponds to the integration of delayed sensory information, including the prior on motion. The right-hand illustrates the target layer corresponding to the same information but after the occurrence of some motion extrapolation compensating for the known neural delay τ.&#34;&gt;

Despite the simplicity of this solution, parodiction has elements that may seem counter-intuitive. Indeed, in this model, the physical world is considered &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo;, that is to say, it can only be guessed by our sensations and our experience. The role of visual perception is then to deliver to our central nervous system the most likely information despite the different sources of noise, ambiguity and time delays. According to the authors of this publication, the visual treatment would consist in a &amp;ldquo;simulation&amp;rdquo; of the visual world projected at the present time, even before the visual information can actually modulate, confirm or cancel this simulation. This hypothesis, which seems to belong to &amp;ldquo;science fiction&amp;rdquo;, is being tested with more detailed and biologically plausible hierarchical neural network models that should allow us to better understand the mysteries underlying our perception. Visual illusions have still the power to amaze us!

As an object moves in visual space (as represented here for commodity by the red trajectory of a tennis ball in a space–time diagram with a one-dimensional space on the vertical axis), the sensory flux may be interrupted by a sudden and transient blank (as denoted by the vertical, gray area and the dashed trajectory).

We represent as arrows the velocity vectors that are most likely detected by a motion energy model; hue indicates direction angle. Due to the limited size of receptive fields in sensory cortical areas (such as shown by the dotted white circle), such problem is faced by local populations of neurons that visually estimate the motion of objects. (A-inset) On a polar representation of possible velocity vectors (the cross in the center corresponds to the null velocity, the outer circle corresponding to twice the amplitude of physical speed), we plot the empirical histogram of detected velocity vectors. This representation gives a quantification of the aperture problem in the velocity domain: At the onset of motion detection, information is concentrated along an elongated constraint line (white=high probability, black=zero probability). (B) We use the prior knowledge that in natural scenes, motion as defined by its position and velocity is following smooth trajectories. Quantitatively, it means that velocity is approximately conserved and that position is transported according to the known velocity. We show here such a transition on position and velocity (respectively $x_t$ and $V_t$) from time t to t &amp;#43; dt with the perturbation modeling the smoothness of prediction in position and velocity (respectively $N_x$ and $N_V$). (C) Applying such a prior on a dynamical system detecting motion, we show that motion converges to the physical motion after approximately one spatial period (the line moved by twice its height). (C-Inset) The read-out of the system converged to the physical motion: Motion-based prediction is sufficient to resolve the aperture problem. (D) As observed at the perceptual level [Castet et al., 1993, Pei et al., 2010], size and duration of the tracking angle bias decreased with respect to the height of the line. Height was measured relative to a spatial period (respectively 60%, 40% and 20%). Here we show the average tracking angle red-out from the probabilistic representation as a function of time, averaged over 20 trials (error bars show one standard deviation).&#34;&gt;

We tested different levels of sensory noise with respect to different levels of internal noise, that is, to different values of the strength of prediction. (Right) Results show the emergence of different states for different prediction precisions: a regime when prediction is weak and which shows high tracking error and variability (No Tracking - NT), a phase for intermediate values of prediction strength (as in Figure 1) exhibiting a low tracking error and low variability in the tracking phase (True Tracking - TT) and finally a phase corresponding to higher precisions with relatively efficient mean detection but high variability (False Tracking - FT). We give 3 representative examples of the emerging states at one contrast level (C = 0.1) with starting (red) and ending (blue) points and respectively NT, TT and FT by showing inferred trajectories for each trial. (Left) We define tracking error as the ratio between detected speed and target speed and we plot it with respect to the stimulus contrast as given by the inverse of sensory noise. Error bars give the variability in tracking error as averaged over 20 trials. As prediction strength increases, there is a transition from smooth contrast response function (NT) to more binary responses (TT and FT).&#34;&gt;

Here, we focus on one step of the algorithm by testing different trajectories at three key positions of the segment stimulus: the two edges and the center (dashed circles). Compared to the pure sensory velocity likelihood (left insets in grayscale), prediction modulates response as shown by the velocity vectors (direction coded as hue as in Figure 1) and by the ratio of velocity probabilities (log ratio in bits, right insets). There is no change for the middle of the segment (yellow tone), but trajectories that are predicted out of the line are “explained away” (navy tone) while others may be amplified (orange tone). Notice the asymmetry between both edges, the upper edge carrying a suppressive predictive information while the bottom edge diffuses coherent motion. (Bottom) Finally, the aperture problem is solved due to the repeated application of this spatio-temporal contextual information modulation. To highlight the anisotropic diffusion of information over the rest of the line, we plot as a function of time (horizontal axis) the histogram of the detected motion marginalized over horizontal positions (vertical axis), while detected direction of velocity is given by the distribution of hues. Blueish colors correspond to the direction perpendicular to the diagonal while a green color represents a disambiguated motion to the right (as in Figure 1). The plot shows that motion is disambiguated by progressively explaining away incoherent motion. Note the asymmetry in the propagation of coherent information.&#34;&gt;
