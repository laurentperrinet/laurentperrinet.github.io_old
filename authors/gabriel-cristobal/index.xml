&lt;h1 id=&#34;biologically-inspired-computer-vision&#34;&gt;Biologically Inspired Computer Vision&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As state-of-the-art imaging technologies becomes more and more advanced, yielding scientific data at unprecedented detail and volume, the need to process and interpret all the data has made image processing and computer vision also increasingly important. Sources of data that have to be routinely dealt with today applications include video transmission, wireless communication, automatic fingerprint processing, massive databanks, non-weary and accurate automatic airport screening, robust night vision to name a few. Multidisciplinary inputs from other disciplines such as computational neuroscience, cognitive science, mathematics, physics and biology will have a fundamental impact in the progress of imaging and vision sciences. One of the advantages of the study of biological organisms is to devise very diﬀerent type of computational paradigms beyond the usual von Neumann e.g. by implementing a neural network with a high degree of local connectivity.

This is a comprehensive and rigorous reference in the area of biologically motivated vision sensors. The study of biologically visual systems can be considered as a two way avenue. On the one hand, biological organisms can provide a source of inspiration for new computational efficient and robust vision models and on the other hand machine vision approaches can provide new insights for understanding biological visual systems. Along the different chapters, this book covers a wide range of topics from fundamental to more specialized topics, including visual analysis based on a computational level, hardware implementation, and the design of new more advanced vision sensors. The last two sections of the book provide an overview of a few representative applications and current state of the art of the research in this area. This makes it a valuable book for graduate, Master, PhD students and also researchers in the field.
This book contains 17 chapters that have been organized in four different parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications

(a) Schematic contours of the log-Gabor filters in the Fourier domain with 5 scales and 8 orientations (only the contours at 78% of the filter maximum are drawn). (b) The real part of the corresponding filters is drawn in the spatial domain. The two first scales are drawn at the bottom magnified by a factor of 4 for a better visualization. The different scales are arranged in rows and the orientations in columns. The low-pass filter is drawn in the upper-left part. (c) The corresponding imaginary parts of the filters are shown in the same arrangement. Note that the low-pass filter does not have imaginary part. Insets (b) and (c) show the final filters built through all the processes described in Section 2. (d) In the proposed scheme the elongation of log-Gabor wavelets increases with the number of orientations nt . Here the real parts (left column) and imaginary parts (right column) are drawn for the 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 orientation schemes. (e) As a comparison orthogonal wavelet filters ‘Db4’ are shown. Horizontal, vertical and diagonal wavelets are arranged on columns (low-pass on top). (f) As a second comparison, steerable pyramid filters (Portilla et al., 2003) are shown. The arrangement over scales and orientations is the same as for the log-Gabor scheme.&#34;&gt;

Simple cortical cells are modeled through log-Gabor functions. They are organized in pairs in quadrature of phase (dark-gray circles). For each position the set of different orientations compose a pinwheel (large light-gray circles). The retinotopic organization induces that adjacent spatial positions are arranged in adjacent pinwheels. Inhibition interactions occur towards the closest adjacent positions which are in the direc-tions perpendicular to the cell preferred orientation and toward adjacent orientations (light-red connections). Facilitation occurs to-wards co-aligned cells up to a larger distance (dark-blue connections).&#34;&gt;
