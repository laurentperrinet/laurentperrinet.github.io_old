Simple cortical cells are modeled through log-Gabor functions. They are organized in pairs in quadrature of phase (dark-gray circles). For each position the set of different orientations compose a pinwheel (large light-gray circles). The retinotopic organization induces that adjacent spatial positions are arranged in adjacent pinwheels. Inhibition interactions occur towards the closest adjacent positions which are in the direc-tions perpendicular to the cell preferred orientation and toward adjacent orientations (light-red connections). Facilitation occurs to-wards co-aligned cells up to a larger distance (dark-blue connections).&#34;&gt;
