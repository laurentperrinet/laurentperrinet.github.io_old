Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combination of saccades and smooth eye  movements.  These  movements  allow  us  to  align  and  stabilize  the  object  on  the  fovea,  thus  enabling  high*resolution  visual  analysis.  When  predictive  information  is  available  about  target  motion,  anticipatory  smooth  pursuit  eye  movements  (aSPEM)  are  efficiently  generated  before  target  appearance,  which  reduce  the  typical  sensorimotor  delay  between  target  motion  onset  and  foveation.  It  is  generally  assumed  that  the  role  of  anticipatory  eye  movements  is  to  limit  the  behavioral  impairment  due  to  eye*to*target  position  and  velocity  mismatch.  By  manipulating  the  probability  for  target  motion  direction  we  were  able  to  bias  the  direction  and  mean  velocity  of  aSPEM, as measured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp*motion onset. This suggests that  probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for  the  initiation  of  anticipatory  movements.  However,  such  estimate  may  become  particularly  challenging  in  a  dynamic  context,  where  the  probabilistic  contingencies  vary  in  time  in  an  unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the information processing underlying the buildup  of  aSPEM  is  linked  to  an  explicit  estimate  of  probabilities  is  unknown.  We  developed  a  new  paired* task  paradigm  in  order  to  address  these  two  questions.  In  a  first  session,  participants  observe  a  target  moving  horizontally  with  constant  speed  from  the  center  either  to  the  right  or  left  across  trials. The probability of either motion direction changes randomly in time. Participants are asked to  estimate "how much they are confident that the target will move to the right or left in the next trial"  and to adjust the cursor's position on the screen accordingly. In a second session the participants eye  movements are recorded during the observation of the same sequence of random*direction trials. In  parallel,  we  are  developing  new  automatic  routines  for  the  advanced  analysis  of  oculomotor  traces.  In  order  to  extract  the  relevant  parameters  of  the  oculomotor  responses  (latency,  gain,  initial  acceleration,  catch*up  saccades),  we  developed  new  tools  based  on  best*fitting  procedure  of  predefined patterns (i.e. the typical smooth pursuit velocity profile).
