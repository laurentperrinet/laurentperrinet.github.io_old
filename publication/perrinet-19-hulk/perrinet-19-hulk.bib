 abstract = {The formation of structure in the visual system, that is, of the connections between cells within neural populations, is by large an unsupervised learning process: the emergence of this architecture is mostly self-organized. In the primary visual cortex of mammals, for example, one can observe during development the formation of cells selective to localized, oriented features which results in the development of a representation of contours in area V1. We modeled such a process using sparse Hebbian learning algorithms. These algorithms alternate a coding step to encode the information with a learning step to find the proper encoder. We identified here a major difficulty of classical solutions in their ability to deduce a good representation while knowing immature encoders, and to learn good encoders with a non-optimal representation. To solve this problem, we propose to introduce a new regulation process between learning and coding, called homeostasis. It is compatible with a neuromimetic architecture and allows for a more efficient emergence of localized filters sensitive to orientation. The key to this algorithm lies in a simple adaptation mechanism based on non-linear functions that reconciles the antagonistic processes that occur at the coding and learning time scales. We tested this unsupervised algorithm with this homeostasis rule for a series of learning algorithms coupled with different neural coding algorithms. In addition, we propose a simplification of this optimal homeostasis rule by implementing a simple heuristic on the probability of activation of neurons. Compared to the optimal homeostasis rule, we show that this heuristic allows to implement a faster unsupervised learning algorithm while retaining much of its effectiveness. These results demonstrate the potential application of such a strategy in computer vision and machine learning and we illustrate it with a result in a convolutional neural network.},
