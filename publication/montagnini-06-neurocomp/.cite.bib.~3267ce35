 abstract = {The quality of the representation of an object's motion is limited
by the noise in the sensory input as well as by an intrinsic ambiguity
due to the spatial limitation of the visual motion analyzers (aperture
problem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that motion
processing of extended ob jects is initially dominated by the local
1D motion cues orthogonal to the ob ject's edges, whereas 2D information
takes progressively over and leads to the final correct represen-
tation of global motion. A Bayesian framework accounting for the
sensory noise and general expectancies for ob ject velocities has
proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning
early motion processing [1, 2, 3]. However, a complete functional
model, encompassing the dynamical evolution of object motion perception
is still lacking. Here we outline several experimental observations
concerning human smooth pursuit of moving ob jects and more particu-
larly the time course of its initiation phase. In addition, we
propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, motivated and
constrained by our oculomotor data, to describe the dynamical integration
of 1D and 2D motion information.},
