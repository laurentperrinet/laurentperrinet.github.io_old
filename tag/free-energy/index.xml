      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;active-inference-tracking-eye-movements-and-oculomotor-delays&#34;&gt;Active Inference, tracking eye movements and oculomotor delays&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking eye movements face a difficult task: they have to be fast while they suffer inevitable delays. If we focus on area MT of humans for instance as it is crucial for detecting the motion of visual objects, sensory information coming to this area is already lagging some 35 milliseconds behind operational time – that is, it reflects some past information. Still the fastest action that may be done there is only able to reach the effector muscles of the eyes some 40 milliseconds later – that is, in the future. The tracking eye movement system is however able to respond swiftly and even to anticipate repetitive movements (e.g. Barnes et al, 2000 – refs in manuscript). In that case, it means that information in a cortical area is both predicted from the past sensory information but also anticipated to give an optimal response in the future. Even if numerous models have been described to model different mechanisms to account for delays, no theoretical approach has tackled the whole problem explicitly. In several areas of vision research, authors have proposed models at different levels of abstractions from biomechanical models, to neurobiological implementations (e.g. Robinson, 1986) or Bayesian models. This study is both novel and important because – using a neurobiologically plausible hierarchical Bayesian model – it demonstrates that using generalized coordinates to finesse the prediction of a target&amp;rsquo;s motion, the model can reproduce characteristic properties of tracking eye movements in the presence of delays. Crucially, the different refinements to the model that we propose – pursuit initiation, smooth pursuit eye movements, and anticipatory response – are consistent with the different types of tracking eye movements that may be observed experimentally.

Here, we see horizontal excursions of oculomotor angle (red line). One can see clearly the initial displacement of the target that is suppressed by action after a few hundred milliseconds. Additionally, we illustrate the effects of assuming wrong sensorimotor delays on pursuit initiation. Under pure sensory delays (blue dotted line), one can see clearly the delay in sensory predictions, in relation to the true inputs. With pure motor delays (blue dashed line) and with combined sensorimotor delays (blue line) there is a failure of optimal control with oscillatory fluctuations in oculomotor trajectories, which may become unstable. **(B)** This figure reports the simulation of smooth pursuit when the target motion is hemi-sinusoidal, as would happen for a pendulum that would be stopped at each half cycle left of the vertical (broken black lines in the lower-right panel). We report the horizontal excursions of oculomotor angle. The generative model used here has been equipped with a second hierarchical level that contains hidden states, modeling latent periodic behavior of the (hidden) causes of target motion. With this addition, the improvement in pursuit accuracy apparent at the onset of the second cycle of motion is observed (pink shaded area), similar to psychophysical experimentss.&#34; srcset=&#34;
