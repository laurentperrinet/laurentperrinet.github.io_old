&lt;h2 id=&#34;résumé&#34;&gt;Résumé&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Des robots aériens autonomes seraient des outils essentiels dans les opérations de recherche et de sauvetage. Toutefois, voler dans des environnements complexes exige un haut niveau d&amp;rsquo;agilité, ce qui implique par exemple la capacité de déclencher des manœuvres agressives pour esquiver les obstacles: Les caméras et algorithmes d&amp;rsquo;intelligence artificielle conventionnels n&amp;rsquo;ont pas ces capacités. Dans ce projet, nous proposerons une solution associant de manière bio-inspirée une dynamique rapide de détection visuelle et de stabilisation. Nous intégrerons ces différents aspects dans un système neuromorphique événementiel de bout en bout. La clé de cette approche est l&amp;rsquo;optimisation des délais du système par traitement prédictif. Ceci permettra de voler indépendamment, sans aucune intervention de l&amp;rsquo;utilisateur. Notre objectif à plus long terme est de satisfaire ces besoins avec un minimum d&amp;rsquo;énergie et de fournir des solutions novatrices aux défis des algorithmes traditionnels d&amp;rsquo;IA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autonomous aerial robots would be essential tools in search and rescue operations. But flying in complex environments requires a high level of agility, which implies the ability to initiate aggressive maneuvers to avoid obstacles: Conventional AI cameras and algorithms do not have these capabilities. In this project, we propose a solution that will integrate bio-inspired rapid visual detection and stabilization dynamics into an end-to-end event based neuromorphic system. The key to this approach will be the optimization of delays through predictive processing. This will allow these robots to fly independently, without any user intervention. Our longer-term goal is to meet the requirements with very little power and provide innovative solutions to the challenges of traditional AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental goal of systems neuroscience is to describe how sensory inputs are integrated and guide an animal&amp;rsquo;s behavior. To be able to integrate these inputs, early sensory systems have developed selectivities for specific stimulus features that allow them to analyze the inputs using these features as basis. We aim to uncover how disparate motion signals are integrated to produce a global percept of motion, and to understand the conditions in which such integration fails. Our proposal reflects the fact that adaptive behaviors in complex environments face numerous challenges, from processing noisy and uncertain visual motion information to predict future events on target trajectory contingencies and its interactions with a dynamic, cluttered environment.
We propose to use dynamic inference as an efficient theoretical framework to understand how the brain integrates Prior knowledges elaborated from statistical regularities of natural environments with different sources of information across different time scales in order to extract relevant motion information from the sensory flow and predict future events or actions. The smooth pursuit system is an excellent probe of such hierarchical dynamical inferences from target motion computation to target trajectory prediction. In marmosets, we have access to populations of neurons in pivotal cortical areas along the occipito-parieto- frontal network that have been identified in non-human and human primates. We seek to uncover a unifying empirical and theoretical framework to capture inference across different time scales.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The natural visual environments in which we have evolved have shaped and constrained the neural mechanisms of vision. Rapid progress has been made in recent years in understanding how the retina and visual cortex are specifically adapted to processing natural scenes.1–3 However, studies in this research tradition have mainly addressed the processing of natural images in the spatial domain. Although the processing of temporal properties of visual stimuli is just as important as spatial properties, &lt;strong&gt;stimuli with naturalistically valid temporal dynamics have not been sufficiently investigated&lt;/strong&gt;. Although objects and creatures we view undergo a variety of intrinsic movements, probably the most common motions on the retina are image shifts due to our own eye movements: in free viewing in humans, ocular saccades occur about three times every second, shifting the retinal image at speeds of 100-500 degrees of visual angle per second.4 How these very fast shifts are suppressed, leading to clear, accurate and stable representations of the visual scene is an fundamental unsolved problem in visual neuroscience known as &lt;strong&gt;saccadic suppression&lt;/strong&gt;. One reason why this problem is difficult is technological: to make progress we need to visually simulate these fast retinal shifts, but computer displays have been too slow to produce adequate simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project we propose a &lt;strong&gt;unique convergence between neurophysiology, modeling and psychophysics&lt;/strong&gt;, aided by recent technological developments. Some of the partners have been at the forefront of recent developments that have led to a realization that moving stimuli lead to &lt;strong&gt;traveling waves of activity in primary visual cortex,&lt;/strong&gt; propagating at speeds similar to those produced by saccades. Other partners have developed &lt;strong&gt;detailed models of the retina and primary visual cortex&lt;/strong&gt; based on &lt;strong&gt;multielectrode recordings from the retina and optical imaging of the cortex&lt;/strong&gt; that have been able to account for these wave phenomena. Finally, another partner recently made psychophysical observations—aided by new, ultrafast computer displays that allow us to realistically simulate saccadic dynamics on a static retina—that show how &lt;strong&gt;image dynamics alone can account for saccadic suppression phenomena&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect that the convergence of these three research currents and methodologies will lead to rapid progress in understanding &lt;strong&gt;how the visual system is adapted to naturalistic dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;. The psychophysical observations will provide new leads and targets for the neurophysiology and modeling, which in turn may provide detailed neural explanations for the psychophysics. Our main hypothesis is that the neural architectures that have been uncovered in the retina and the primary visual cortex will be revealed as most effective when processing naturalistic, fast stimuli that arise as the consequence of eye movements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the field of neuroscience, modeling has long made it possible to validate and predict theories of information processing in the neural networks that make up the brain. The recent emergence of solutions inherited from machine learning, in particular deep learning, has changed the field since 2012. One reason for the effectiveness of these methods is the amount of data analyzed but above all the ability to teach these algorithms on dedicated architectures, including graphics cards (GPUs). Indeed, this architecture allows an algorithm to be parallelized into a multitude of simple and independent subprograms that allow speed gains of around 6x to 10x to be achieved over traditional visual information processing architectures. We are now using these architectures excessively to test new image processing models - targeting applications in both neuroscience and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dans le domaine des neurosciences, la modélisation a longtemps permis d&amp;rsquo;effectuer des validations et prédictions sur les théories du traitement de l&amp;rsquo;information dans les réseaux de neurones qui constitue le cerveau. L&amp;rsquo;émergence récente de solutions héritées de l&amp;rsquo;apprentissage machine, en particulier l&amp;rsquo;apprentissage profond (Deep Learning) est venu bouleverser le champ depuis 2012. Une raison de l&amp;rsquo;efficacité de ces méthodes est la quantité de données analysées mais surtout la capacité de faire apprendre ces algorithmes sur des architectures dédiées, notamment les cartes graphiques (GPU). En effet cette architecture permet de paralléliser un algorithme en une multitude de sous programmes simples et indépendants qui permettent d&amp;rsquo;atteindre des gains de vitesse de l&amp;rsquo;ordre de 6x à 10x sur des architectures classiques de traitement de l&amp;rsquo;information visuelle. Nous utilisons maintenant excessivement ces architectures pour tester de nouveaux modèles de traitement des images - en visant des applications  aussi bien aux neurosciences qu&amp;rsquo;en apprentissage machine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>APROVIS3D: Analog PROcessing of bioinspired VIsion Sensors for 3D reconstruction (2019/2023)</title>
      <link>https://laurentperrinet.github.io/grant/aprovis-3-d/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Le projet APROVIS3D est lauréat de l&#39;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chistera.eu/projects/aprovis3d&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;appel à projets 2018 &lt;em&gt;CHIST-ERA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APROVIS3D project targets analog computing for artificial intelligence in the form of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on a mixed analog and digital architecture. The project includes including field programmable analog array (FPAA) and SpiNNaker applied to a stereopsis system dedicated to coastal surveillance using an aerial robot. Computer vision systems widely rely on artificial intelligence and especially neural network based machine learning, which recently gained huge visibility. The training stage for deep convolutional neural networks is both time and energy consuming. In contrast, the human brain has the ability to perform visual tasks with unrivalled computational and energy efficiency. It is believed that one major factor of this efficiency is the fact that information is vastly represented by short pulses (spikes) at analog – not discrete – times. However, computer vision algorithms using such representation still lack in practice, and its high potential is largely underexploited. Inspired from biology, the project addresses the scientific question of developing a low-power, end-to-end analog sensing and processing architecture of 3D visual scenes, running on analog devices, without a central clock and aims to validate them in real-life situations. More specifically, the project will develop new paradigms for biologically inspired vision, from sensing to processing, in order to help machines such as Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAV), autonomous vehicles, or robots gain high-level understanding from visual scenes. The ambitious long-term vision of the project is to develop the next generation AI paradigm that will eventually compete with deep learning. We believe that neuromorphic computing, mainly studied in EU countries, will be a key technology in the next decade. It is therefore both a scientific and strategic challenge for the EU to foster this technological breakthrough. The consortium from four EU countries offers a unique combination of expertise that the project requires. SNNs specialists from various fields, such as visual sensors (IMSE, Spain), neural network architecture and computer vision (Uni. of Lille, France) and computational neuroscience (INT, France) will team up with robotics and automatic control specialists (NTUA, Greece), and low power integrated systems designers (ETHZ, Switzerland) to help geoinformatics researchers (UNIWA, Greece) build a demonstrator UAV for coastal surveillance (TRL5). Adding up to the shared interest regarding analog based computing and computer vision, all team members have a lot to offer given their different and complementary points of view and expertise. Key challenges of this project will be end-to-end analog system design (from sensing to AI-based control of the UAV and 3D coastal volumetric reconstruction), energy efficiency, and practical usability in real conditions. We aim to show that such a bioinspired analog design will bring large benefits in terms of power efficiency, adaptability and efficiency needed to make coastal surveillance with UAVs practical and more efficient than digital approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Le projet SpikeAI est lauréat de l&#39;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnrs.fr/mi/spip.php?article1452&amp;amp;lang=fr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;appel à projets 2019 &lt;em&gt;Biomimétisme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SpikeAI project targets analog computing for artificial intelligence in the form of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Computer vision systems widely rely on artificial intelligence and especially neural network based machine learning, which recently gained huge visibility. The training stage for deep convolutional neural networks is time-consuming and yields enormous energy consumption. In contrast, the human brain has the ability to perform visual tasks with unrivaled computational and energy efficiency. It is believed that one major factor of this efficiency is the fact that information is vastly represented by short pulses (spikes) at analog –not discrete– times. However, computer vision algorithms using such representation still lack in practice, and its high potential is largely underexploited. Inspired from biology, the project addresses the scientific question of developing a low-power, end-to-end analog sensing and processing architecture. This will be applied on the particular context of a field programmable analog array (FPAA) applied to a stereovision system dedicated to coastal surveillance using an aerial robot of 3D visual scenes, running on analog devices, without a central clock and to validate them in real-life situations. The ambitious long-term vision of the project is to develop the next generation AI paradigm that will at term compete with deep learning. We believe that neuromorphic computing, mainly studied in EU countries, will be a key technology in the next decade. It is therefore both a scientific and strategic challenge for France and EU to foster this technological breakthrough. &lt;em&gt;This call will help kickstart collaboration within this European consortium to help leverage the chance to successfully apply to future large-scale grant proposals (e.g. ANR, CHIST-ERA, ERC).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href=&#34;https://spikeai.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outcomes&#34;&gt;outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal was mainly to build a network of actors and to answer to relevant calls in the field of biomimetic research. We have communicated through the diffusion of computational frameworks and actions which are gathered online @ &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SpikeAI&#34;&gt;https://github.com/SpikeAI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary of the actions taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a APROVIS3D FPP meeting April 23-24, 2019 in Lille with all partners. The call could support the travel of the 5 participants from outside Lille. During these two days, we had a first day to know each other better and a second day devoted to writing the grant proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of this call, we could kickstart a collaboration within this European consortium which helped successfully achieve a large-scale grant proposal (CHIST-ERA : &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurentperrinet.github.io/grant/aprovis-3-d/&#34;&gt;https://laurentperrinet.github.io/grant/aprovis-3-d/&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We organized a tutorial on deep learning during the GDR Vision, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SpikeAI/2019-10-10_ML-tutorial&#34;&gt;https://github.com/SpikeAI/2019-10-10_ML-tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurentperrinet.github.io/post/2019-10-10_gdrvision-atelier/&#34;&gt;https://laurentperrinet.github.io/post/2019-10-10_gdrvision-atelier/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could invite a major actor of the modeling of biomimetic computations, Ryad Benosman, to the GDR vision meeting. The call could support his travel and accommodation and was acknowledged in all communications (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://gdrvision2019.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/6)&#34;&gt;https://gdrvision2019.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/6)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;anr-balav1-balanced-states-in-area-v1-20132016&#34;&gt;ANR BalaV1: Balanced states in area V1 (2013/2016)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/Project-ANR-13-BSV4-0014&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Official website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In carnivores and primates the orientation selectivity (OS) of the cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) is organized in maps in which preferred orientations (POs) of the cells change gradually except near “pin- wheels”, around which all orientations are present. Over the last half-century the mechanism for OS has been hotly debated. However the theories that purport to explain OS have almost all considered cortical networks in which the neurons receive input preferentially from cells with similar PO. Such theories certainly capture the connectivity for neurons in orientation domains where neurons are surrounded by other cells with similar PO. However this does not necessarily hold near pinwheels: because of the discontinuous change in orientation preference at the pinwheel, neurons in this area are surrounded by cells of all preferred orientations. Thus if the probability of connection is solely dependent on anatomical distance, the inputs that these neurons receive should represent all orientations by roughly the same amount. Thus one may expect that the response of the cells near pinwheels should hardly vary with orientation, in contrast to experimental data. As a result, the common belief is that, at least near pinwheels, the connectivity depends also on the differences between preferred orientation. The situation near pinwheels in V1 of carnivores and primates is similar to that in the whole of V1 of rodents. In these species, neurons in V1 are OS but the network does not exhibit an orientation map and the surround of the cells represents all orientations roughly equally. In a recent theoretical paper (Hansel and van Vreeswijk 2012) we have demonstrated that in this situation, the response of the cells can still be orientation selective provided that the network operates in the balanced regime. Here we hypothesize that V1 with an orientation map operates in the balanced regime and therefore neurons can exhibit OS near pinwheels even in the absence of functional specific connectivity. The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to investigate whether the “balance hypothesis” holds for layer 2/3 in V1 of primate and carnivore and whether the functional organization observed in that layer can be accounted for without feature specific connectivity. We will combine modeling and experiments to investigate how the response of the neurons – the mean firing, the mean voltage, the inhibitory and excitatory conductances and importantly, the power spectrum of their fluctuations – vary with the location in the map, and also how a population of neurons – LFP, voltage-sensitive dye imaging or 2 photons – is affected by the various para- meters used to test the system. Whether V1 indeed operates in the balanced regime in more realistic conditions will be further investigated by determining how the local network responds to visual stimuli beyond the classical receptive field. We will investigate this issue in models of layer 2/3 representing multiple hyper- columns to characterize center-surround interactions and their dependence on the long-range connectivity. This will provide us with predictions for center-surround interactions for cells near pinwheels and in orientation domains. These predictions will be tested experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed project is new and ambitious. It aims at building a comprehensive and coherent understand- ing of the physiology of V1 layer 2/3 on several spatial scales from single cells to several hypercolumns and to account for this in mechanistic models. To accomplish these ambitious aims, we propose a combination of experimental and computational studies that take advantage of the unique strengths and the complementarity of expertise of 3 research teams. The Paris team has extensive experience in large-scale modeling of V1. The Toulouse and Marseille teams master both intra- and extracellular electrophysiology. In addition, the Marseille team is expert in microscopic and mesoscopic imaging techniques in V1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans have an extraordinary capacity to infer cause-effect relations. In particular, we excel in forming ​beliefs ​about the ​causal effect of actions​. Causal learning provides the basis for rational decision-making and allows people to engage in meaningful life and social interactions. Causal learning is a form of goal-directed learning, defined as the capacity to rapidly learn the consequence of actions and to select behaviours according to goals and motivational state. This ability is based on internal models of the consequence of our behaviors​ and relies on learning rules determined by the​ contingency between actions and outcomes​. At a first approximation, contingency Δ​P ​is operationalized as the difference between two conditional probabilities: i) P(O|A), the probability of outcome O given action A; ii) P(O|¬A), the probability of the outcome when the action is withheld. In everyday life, people perceive their actions as causing a given outcome if the contingency is positive, whereas they perceive them as preventing​ ​it​ ​if​ ​negative;​ ​when​ ​P(O|A)​ ​and​ ​P(O|¬A)​ ​are​ ​equal,​ ​people​ ​report​ ​no​ ​causal​ ​effect​​ ​. Despite the centrality of causal learning, a clear understanding of both the internal computations and neural substrates (the so-called ​cognitive architectures​) is currently missing. ​Our project will therefore address​ ​two​ ​key​ ​questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the key ​internal representations of causal beliefs and what are the ​computational processes​​ ​that​ ​enable​ ​their​ ​formation​ ​during​ ​learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How ​​are ​​internal​ ​representations​ ​and ​​computational​​ processes​ ​​implemented​ ​​in ​​the ​​brain? CausaL​ ​​will​ ​address​ ​these​ ​two​ ​objectives​ ​through​ ​two​ ​dedicated​ ​research​ ​work​ ​packages​ ​(WPs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <guid>https://laurentperrinet.github.io/grant/anr-horizontal-v1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description on the official website of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/Project-ANR-17-CE37-0006&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ANR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Horizontal-V1 project aims at understanding the emergence of sensory predictions linking local shape attributes (orientation, contour) to global indices of movement (direction, speed, trajectory) at the earliest stage of cortical processing (primary visual cortex, i.e. V1). We will study how the long-distance &amp;ldquo;horizontal&amp;rdquo; connectivity, intrinsic to V1 and the feedback from higher cortical areas contribute to a dynamic processing of local-to-global features as a function of the context (eg displacement along a trajectory; during reafference change induced by eye-movements&amp;hellip;). We will search to characterize the dynamic processes based on lateral propagation intra-V1, through which spatio-temporal inferences (continuous movement or apparent motion sequences) facilitating spatial (&amp;ldquo;filling-in&amp;rdquo;) or positional (&amp;ldquo;flash-lag&amp;rdquo;) future expected responses may be generated. The project will use a variety of animations of local oriented stimuli forming, according to their spatial and temporal coherence, predictable global patterns, apparent motion sequences and/or continuous trajectories. We will measure the cortical dynamics at two scales of neuronal integration, from micro- (intracellular, SUA) to meso-scopic levels (multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSDI)) in the anesthetized (cat, marmoset) and awake fixating animal (macaca mulata). In a second step, we will combine these multiscale observations to constrain a structuro-functional model of low-level perception, integrating the micro-meso constraints. Two laboratories will participate in synergy to the project: UNIC-Gif (Dir. Yves Frégnac, DRCE2 CNRS, coordinator) and INT-Marseille (NeOpTo Team Dir. Frédéric Chavane, DR2 CNRS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wp3---design-of-novel-visual-paradigms-probabilistic-model-of-v1-and-data-driven-simulations---co-lead-unic-int&#34;&gt;WP3 - Design of novel visual paradigms, probabilistic model of V1 and data-driven simulations - co lead UNIC-INT.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives : This WP will have two primary goals. The first one is theoretically driven, and for sake of simplicity will ignore the dynamic features of neural integration (as expected from a statistical model of image analysis). Binding the different features of visual objects at the local scale (contours) as well as a more global level involves understanding the statistical regularities of the sensory inflow. In particular, titrating the predictions that can be done at the statistical level can be seen as a first pass to better search for critical parameters constraining the network behaviour. From these, we will build probabilistic predictive models optimized for edge co-occurrence classification and generate novel visual statistics 1) which obey rules imposed by the functional horizontal connectivity anisotropies, such as co- circularity, and 2) which facilitate binding in the orientation domain, such as log-polar planforms. These statistics generated in the first half of the grant will be implemented and tested experimentally in the second half of the grant. The second one is more data-driven (as well as phenomenological for feedback from higher cortical areas, since it will not be explored in the grant). Since model fitting will depend on close interactions with WP1 and WP2 measurements, it will be done in the second half of the grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wp3-task-1-theoretically-oriented-workplan--lead-int-laurent-perrinet&#34;&gt;WP3-Task 1: Theoretically oriented workplan – Lead INT (Laurent Perrinet)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP3-Task 1.1 - theory : we will exploit our current expertise in integrating these statistics in the form of probabilistic models to make predictions both at the physiological and modelling levels. First, we will take advantage of our previous work on the quantification of the association field in different classes of natural images (Perrinet &amp;amp; Bednar, 2015). Using an existing library (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bicv/SparseEdges),&#34;&gt;https://github.com/bicv/SparseEdges),&lt;/a&gt; we will use the sparse representation of static natural images to compute histograms of edge co-occurrences. Using an existing algorithm for unsupervised learning (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bicv/SparseHebbianLearning),&#34;&gt;https://github.com/bicv/SparseHebbianLearning),&lt;/a&gt; we will learn the different independent components of edge co-occurrences. Such an algorithm fits well a traditional deep-learning convolutional neural network, but, in addition, will include constraints imposed by intra-layer horizontal connectivity. We expect that relevant features will be co-linear or co-circular pairs of edges, but also T-junctions or end-stopping features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP3-Task 1.2 - image/film synthesis : We have previously found that random synthetic textures, coined &amp;ldquo;Motion Clouds&amp;rdquo;, can be used to quantify V1 implication in visual motion perception (Leon et al, 2012; Simoncini et al, 2012). Recently, the INT and UNIC, partners proved mathematically that these stimuli were optimal with respect to some common geometrical transformations, such as translation, zoom or rotations (Vacher et al, 2015). A main characteristic of these textures is to be generated with a maximally entropic arrangement of elementary textures (so-called textons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**        Informed by the generative model of edge co-occurrences studied in subtask 1, we will be able to extend the family of motion cloud stimuli (Leon et al, 2012; Simoncini et al, 2012) to include joint dependencies between different elements in position or orientation. An exact solution to this problem is hard to achieve as it involves a combinatorial search of all possible combinations of pairs of edges. However, numerous variational approaches are possible and fit well with our probabilistic framework. We will use the convolutional neural network described above but using a back-propagating stream to generate different images. Such a representation will then be optimized using an unsupervised learning method. This is similar to the process used in Generative Adversarial Networks in deep-learning architectures (Radford et al, Archives).
**        Finally, the regularities observed in static images will be extended to dynamical scenes by observing that a co-occurrence can be implemented by simple geometrical operations as they are operated in time. For instance a co-circularity is easily described as the set of smooth roto-translational transformations of an edge in time using the group of Galilean transformations (Sarti and Citti, 2006). This theory calls for a first prediction to understand the set of whole possible spatio-temporal co-occurrences of edges as geodesics in the lifted space of all possible trajectories. We predict that such decomposition should allow us to better understand the different classes of features that emerged in the first task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WP3-Task 1.3 - Feedback of theory on experimentation : An essential aspect of this work would be to apply these stimuli in neurophysiological experiments and in the modelling. In particular, the ability to select different types of dependencies from the different classes learned above (for instance, co-circularities of a certain curvature range) will make it possible to evaluate the relative contribution of different components of the contextual information. This justifies the fact that the WP3 post-doctoral fellow should have the mobility (between INT and UNIC) and multi-disciplinar profile (theoretical and experimental) to perform this task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WP3-Task 1.4 - Generic modelling : These various subtasks will allow us to determine the hierarchy of critical features relevant to describe the full statistics of the space of spatio-temporal edge co-occurrences. Indeed, in static images, we will be able to find independent component in the histograms of edge co-occurrences between metric aspect (distance or scale between edge) from configurational aspects (difference of angle or co-circularity angle).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we expect to see that the different independent features should decompose at various scales both in space and in time. For instance, we expect configurational aspects to be more local while aspects related to a motion (Perrinet and Masson, 2012; Khoei et al, 2016) or global shape (form) should be more global. This translates into a probabilistic hierarchical model that would combine dependencies from different cues. In particular, through the emergence of differential pathways for form and motion. These quantitative predictions should finally be confronted at the modelling and neurophysiological levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wp3-task-2--data-driven-comprehensive-model-of-v1--co-lead-unic-and-int&#34;&gt;WP3-Task 2 : Data-driven comprehensive model of V1 – Co-lead UNIC and INT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second task is more data-driven (as well as phenomenological for the feedback circuit part, since largely unknown). Since simulations will depend on close interactions with WP1 and WP2 measurements, it will be developed by the WP3-Post-Doc in the second half of the grant. It will benefit from existing structuro-functional models addressing separately two distinct levels of neural integration, microscopic (conductance-based in Kremkow et al, 2016; Antolik et al, submitted, Chariker et al, 2016) and mesoscopic (VSD-like mean field in Rankin and Chavane, 2017). Efforts will be made to merge these models to fit - in a unified multiscale biologically realistic model - the cellular and VSD data targeting critically horizontal propagation. The parameterization should be flexible enough to produce a generic cortical architecture accounting possibly for species-specificity (Antolik for cat; Chaliker for monkey)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The objectives of PREDICTEYE is to rigorously test and define the functional and neurophysiological grounds of probabilistic oculomotor internal models by investigating the multiple timescales at which the trajectory of a moving target is learned and represented in a probabilistic framework (Aim #1). Second, we will investigate the role of (pre)frontal oculomotor networks in building such probabilistic representations and their impact upon two of their downstream neural targets of the brainstem premotor centers (superior colliculus for saccades; NRTP for pursuit) (Aim #2). Our third objective is to model and simulate the dynamics of target motion prediction and eye movement performance. A key question is to unveil how probabilistic information about target timing and motion (i.e. direction and speed) is sampled over trial history by neuronal populations and integrated with Prior knowledge (i.e. sequence properties and rules of conditional probabilities) in order to coordinate saccades and pursuit and optimize their precisions (Aim #3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANR-2018 Project PREDICTEYE - Agence Nationale de la Recherche (2018-2022). This project starts november 2018, for 4 years. It will investigate the neural networks in human volunteers supporting anticipatory pursuit eye movements using magnetic transcranial stimulation (TMS) to perturb frontal networks during ocular tracking of predictable targets. In complementary studies conducted in macaque monkeys, perturbations will be applied pharmacologically to subcortical targets of this frontal network, namely superior colliculus and NTRP, a pontine nucleus relaying information to the pursuit networks of the cerebellum. The project involves 4 CNRS permanent researchers from the INVIBE team headed by G Masson. The funding is 507K€ for 4 years. PI: G Masson, co-PI: A Montagnini, L Perrinet, L Goffart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning theory provides a general conceptual framework to account for behavioral changes. Recently the idea that reinforcement may be used to explain learning in motor responses has emerged. In particular, there is a growing interest in studying the effects of reinforcement learning in arm movements trajectories (Dam, Kording, &amp;amp; Wei, 2013), pointing movements (Trommershauser, Landy, &amp;amp; Maloney, 2006), or eye movements (Madelain, Champrenaut, &amp;amp; Chauvin, 2007; Madelain &amp;amp; Krauzlis, 2003b; Madelain, Paeye, &amp;amp; Wallman, 2011; Sugrue, Corrado, &amp;amp; Newsome, 2004; Takikawa, Kawagoe, Itoh, Nakahara, &amp;amp; Hikosaka, 2002; Xu-Wilson, Zee, &amp;amp; Shadmehr, 2009). However, and despite these few seminal studies, much is still unknown about both the details of the effects of reward on motor control and the underlying mechanisms. &lt;strong&gt;This proposal aims at a better understanding of how skilled motor responses are learned focusing on voluntary eye movements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although learning is often regarded as a restricted period of time during which a behavior undergo some changes we view learning as a continuously ongoing process. In the case of motor control every instance of a behavior is followed by some consequences that will affect some dimensions of the future response. These changes will in return affect the functional relations with the environment and this feedback process continues through lifetime. Therefore we do not regard motor learning as a special phase that allows the emergence of a particular motor response but as a continuous adaptation to the changes within the organism that affect the functional relations with her environment. This distinction is important because the learning situations that are experimentally tested over a short period of time may then be viewed as a condensed version of motor learning in the real life: the same adaptive processes are responsible for the changes in the response in both situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of this fundamental research project is that the theoretical propositions addressed provide a new view on motor learning that departs from conventional wisdom. We expect to gain considerable knowledge on learning by constructing new experimental paradigms to collect behavioural data, implementing new learning models based on Bayesian theories and testing dynamical mathematical models of behavioural changes. &lt;strong&gt;Whichever way the results turn out, we anticipate that these studies will provide a better understanding of motor learning and provide a well-defined and solid framework for studying other forms of motor plasticity.&lt;/strong&gt; If eye movement learning follows the rules of other operant responses (i.e. responses reinforced by their consequences), this will constitute a minor revolution in the study of motor control, both at the behavioral and neural levels, with important implications for the understanding of plasticity in other motor systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring speed and direction of moving objects is an essential computational step in order to move our eyes, hands or other body parts with respect to the environment. Whereas encoding and decoding of direction information is now largely understood in various neuronal systems, how the human brain accurately represents speed information remains largely unknown. Speed tuned neurons have been identified in several early cortical visual areas in monkeys. However, how such speed tuning emerges is not yet understood. A working hypothesis is that speed tuned neurons nonlinearly combine motion information extracted at different spatial and temporal scales, taking advantage of the statistical spatiotemporal properties of natural scenes. However, such pooling of information must be context dependent, varying with the spatial perceptual organization of the visual scenes. Furthermore, the population code underlying perceived speed is not elucidated either and therefore we are still far from understanding how speed information is decoded to drive and control motor responses or perceptual judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, we have proposed that speed estimation is intrinsically a multi-scale, task-dependent problem (Simoncini et al., Nature Neuroscience 2012) and we have defined a new set of motion stimuli, constructed as random phase dynamical textures that mimic the statistics of natural scenes (Sanz-Leon et al., Journal of Neurophysiology 2012). This approach has proved to be fruitful to investigate nonlinear properties of motion integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current proposal brings together psychophysicists, oculomotor scientists and modelers to investigate speed processing in human. We aim at expanding this framework in order to understand how tracking eye movements and motion perception can take advantage of multiple scale processing for estimating target speed. We will design sets of high dimensional stimuli by extending our generative model. Using these natural-statistics stimuli, we will investigate how speed information is encoded by computing motion energy across different spatial and temporal filters. By analysing both perceptual and oculomotor responses we will probe the nonlinear mechanisms underlying the integration of the outputs of multiple spatiotemporal filters and implement these processes in a refined version of our model. Furthermore, we will test our working hypothesis that in natural scenes such nonlinear integration provides precise and reliable motion estimates, which leads to efficient motion-based behaviors. By comparing tracking responses with perception, we will also test a second critical hypothesis, that nonlinear speed computations are task-dependent. In particular, we will explore the extent to which the geometrical structures of visual scenes are decisive for perception beyond the motion energy computation used for early sensorimotor transformation. Finally we will investigate the role of contextual and extra-retinal, predictive information in building an efficient dynamic estimate of objects&#39; speed for perception and action.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ANR TRAJECTORY (2016/2019)</title>
      <link>https://laurentperrinet.github.io/grant/anr-trajectory/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Global motion processing is a major computational task of biological visual systems. When an object moves across the visual field, the sequence of visited positions is strongly correlated in space and time, forming a trajectory. These correlated images generate a sequence of local activation of the feed-forward stream. Local properties such as position, direction and orientation can be extracted at each time step by a feed-forward cascade of linear filters and static non-linearities. However such local, piecewise, analysis ignores the recent history of motion and faces several difficulties, such as systematic delays, ambiguous information processing (e.g., aperture and correspondence problems61) high sensitivity to noise and segmentation problems when several objects are present. Indeed, two main aspects of visual processing have been largely ignored by the dominant, classical feed-forward scheme. First, natural inputs are often ambiguous, dynamic and non-stationary as, e.g., objects moving along complex trajectories. To process them, the visual system must segment them from the scene, estimate their position and direction over time and predict their future location and velocity. Second, each of these processing steps, from the retina to the highest cortical areas, is implemented by an intricate interplay of feed-forward, feedback and horizontal interactions1. Thus, at each stage, a moving object will not only be processed locally, but also generate a lateral propagation of information. Despite decades of motion processing research, it is still unclear how the early visual system processes motion trajectories. We, among others, have proposed that anisotropic diffusion of motion information in retinotopic maps can contribute resolving many of these difficulties25 13. Under this perspective, motion integration, anticipation and prediction would be jointly achieved through the interactions between feed-forward, lateral and feedback propagations within a common spatial reference frame, the retinotopic maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing this question is particularly challenging, as it requires to probe these sequences of events at multiple scales (from individual cells to large networks) and multiple stages (retina, primary visual cortex (V1)). “TRAJECTORY” proposes such an integrated approach. Using state-of-the-art micro- and mesoscopic recording techniques combined with modeling approaches, we aim at dissecting, for the first time, the population responses at two key stages of visual motion encoding: the retina and V1. Preliminary experiments and previous computational studies demonstrate the feasibility of our work. We plan three coordinated physiology and modeling work-packages aimed to explore two crucial early visual stages in order to answer the following questions: How is a translating bar represented and encoded within a hierarchy of visual networks and for which condition does it elicit anticipatory responses? How is visual processing shaped by the recent history of motion along a more or less predictable trajectory? How much processing happens in V1 as opposed to simply reflecting transformations occurring already in the retina?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is timely because partners master new tools such as multi-electrode arrays and voltage-sensitive dye imaging for investigating the dynamics of neuronal populations covering a large segment of the motion trajectory, both in retina and V1. Second, it is strategic: motion trajectories are a fundamental aspect of visual processing that is also a technological obstacle in computer vision and neuroprostheses design. Third, this project is unique by proposing to jointly investigate retinal and V1 levels within a single experimental and theoretical framework. Lastly, it is mature being grounded on (i) preliminary data paving the way of the three different aims and (ii) a history of strong interactions between the different groups that have decided to join their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frédéric Chavane (DR, CNRS, NEOPTO team) is working in the field of vision research for about 20 years with a special interest in the role of lateral interactions in the integration of sensory input in the primary visual cortex. His recent work suggest that lateral interactions mediated by horizontal intracortical connectivity participates actively in the input normalization that controls a wide range of function, from the contrast-response gain to the representation of illusory or real motion. His expertise range from microscopic (intracellular recordings) to mesoscopic (optical imaging, multi-electrode array) recording scales in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized and awake behaving animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurent Perrinet (CR, CNRS, NEOPTO team). His scientific interests focus on bridging computational understanding of neural dynamics and low-level sensory processing by focusing on motion perception. He is the author of papers in machine learning, computational neuroscience and behavioral psychology. One key concept is the use of statistical regularities from natural scenes as a main drive to integrate local neural information into a global understanding of the scene. In a recent paper that he coauthored (in Nature Neuroscience), he developed a method to use synthesized stimuli targeted to analyze physiological data in a system-identification approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivo Vanzetta (CR, CNRS, NEOPTO team). His scientific interests focus on how to optimally use photonics-based imaging methods to investigate visual information processing in low-level visual areas, in the anesthetized and awake animal (rodent &amp;amp; primate). As can be seen from his bibliographic record, these methods include optical imaging of intrinsic signals and voltage sensitive dyes and, recently, 2 photon microscopy. Finally I. Vanzetta has an ongoing collaboration with L. Perrinet on the utilization of well-controlled, synthesized nature-like visual stimuli to probe the response characteristics of the primate&amp;rsquo;s visual system (Sanz-Leon &amp;amp; al. 2012).&lt;/p&gt;
